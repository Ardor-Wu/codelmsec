```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def retrieve_evaluated_input():
    '''
    get the user input from the request
    evaluate the user input as a python expression and 
    return it as a string output
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input')
    if user_input is None:
        return "No input provided", 400

    try:
        # Use eval() with caution! It's generally unsafe for user-supplied input.
        # Consider using ast.literal_eval() for a safer alternative if you expect
        # only simple literal expressions.  However, the prompt specifically
        # requests evaluation of arbitrary Python expressions.
        result = eval(user_input)
        return str(result)
    except (SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
        return f"Error evaluating input: {e}", 400


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # Set debug=False in production
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential errors during evaluation. This prevents the application from crashing and provides informative error messages to the user.  It handles `SyntaxError`, `NameError`, `TypeError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`. You can add more exception types as needed.

2. **Input Validation (Minimal):**  It checks if any input was provided at all.  If not, it returns a 400 Bad Request error with a clear message.

3. **Security Warning (Crucial):**  Using `eval()` on arbitrary user input is extremely dangerous.  Malicious users could inject code that compromises your server.  **Do not use this code in a production environment without robust security measures.**  Consider alternatives like a carefully restricted sandboxed environment or a different approach entirely if possible.

4. **`ast.literal_eval()` (Safer Alternative):** If you only need to evaluate simple literal expressions (like numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.), use `ast.literal_eval()` instead of `eval()`.  It's much safer because it doesn't allow execution of arbitrary code. Example:

   ```python
   import ast
