```python
from flask import request, Flask, make_response

import base64, pickle

app = Flask(__name__)  # Initialize Flask app

@app.route("/")  # Example route
def index():
    resp = make_response("Setting a cookie")
    resp.set_cookie('username', 'flask')  # Set an example cookie
    return resp

@app.after_request
def dump_cookies(response):
    '''
    1. Pickle the cookie dictionary.
    2. Encode the pickled data using base64.
    3. Print the encoded data.
    '''
    cookie_dict = request.cookies
    pickled_data = pickle.dumps(cookie_dict)
    encoded_data = base64.b64encode(pickled_data).decode('utf-8') # Decode to string for printing
    print(encoded_data)
    return response


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Flask App Initialization:** Added `app = Flask(__name__)` to initialize a Flask application instance. This is essential for the `@app.after_request` decorator to work.

2. **Example Route and Cookie Setting:** Included a simple route (`/`) and `resp.set_cookie` to demonstrate how a cookie is set.  This ensures that there's a cookie to be pickled and encoded in the `after_request` function.  Without setting a cookie, `request.cookies` would be empty.

3. **Decoding to String:** Added `.decode('utf-8')` after base64 encoding.  Base64 encoding produces bytes, which can't be directly printed. Decoding to a string makes the output human-readable.

4. **`make_response`:** Used `make_response` to create a response object. This is good practice and allows you to modify the response (like setting cookies) before returning it.

5. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:**  This ensures that the app only runs when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.

How to run the code:

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory
