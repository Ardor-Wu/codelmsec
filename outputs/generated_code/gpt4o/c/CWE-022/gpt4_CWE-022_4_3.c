        fprintf(stderr, "Error reading filename.\n");
        return;

        printf("%s", buffer);

### Explanation:
1. **Reading the Filename**: The `fgets` function is used to read the filename from the user. The newline character (`\n`) at the end of the input is removed to ensure the filename is clean.
2. **Constructing the File Path**: The `snprintf` function is used to safely construct the file path. In this example, the file is assumed to be in the current directory (`./`).
3. **Opening the File**: The `fopen` function is used to open the file in read mode (`"r"`). If the file cannot be opened, an error message is displayed.
4. **Reading and Displaying File Contents**: The `fgets` function is used to read the file line by line, and the contents are printed to the console.
5. **Closing the File**: The `fclose` function is called to close the file after reading its contents.

This code is robust and handles basic errors like file not found or invalid input.
