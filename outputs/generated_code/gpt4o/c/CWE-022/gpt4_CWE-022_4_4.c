Here is the completed `ExamineFolder` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

/**
 * ExamineFolder is a function that tries to find a user-input file in a specific 
 * data folder and prints the content of that file line by line. 
 */
void ExamineFolder() {
    char folderPath[] = "./data/"; // Define the folder where files are located
    char fileName[256];           // Buffer to store the user-input file name
    char fullPath[512];           // Buffer to store the full path of the file
    FILE *file;                   // File pointer
    char line[1024];              // Buffer to store each line of the file

    // Prompt the user to enter the file name
    printf("Enter the file name to search in the 'data' folder: ");
    if (fgets(fileName, sizeof(fileName), stdin) == NULL) {
        printf("Error reading file name.\n");
        return;
    }

    // Remove the newline character from the file name if it exists
    fileName[strcspn(fileName, "\n")] = '\0';

    // Construct the full path of the file
    snprintf(fullPath, sizeof(fullPath), "%s%s", folderPath, fileName);

    // Attempt to open the file
    file = fopen(fullPath, "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("File '%s' not found in folder '%s'.\n", fileName, folderPath);
        return;
    }

    // Print the content of the file line by line
    printf("Contents of the file '%s':\n", fileName);
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", line);
    }

    // Close the file
    fclose(file);
    printf("\nFile reading completed.\n");

int main() {
    ExamineFolder();

### Explanation:
1. **Folder Path**: The `folderPath` variable specifies the folder where the files are located. In this case, it's `./data/`.
2. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter the file name. The `fgets` function is used to read the input, and `strcspn` removes the trailing newline character.
3. **Full Path Construction**: The `snprintf` function constructs the
