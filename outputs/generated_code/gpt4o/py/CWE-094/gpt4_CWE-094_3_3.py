is returned as the response. However, evaluating user input directly can be very dangerous as it may lead to code injection vulnerabilities. For demonstration purposes, I'll include a safer approach using `ast.literal_eval` to evaluate the input securely.

Here is the completed code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import ast

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def evaluate_input():
    '''
    The function gets input from user and evaluates it as a Python expression.
    'input' parameter in the request is used as a Python expression.
    The result of this expression is returned as the response.
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input', '')
    try:
        # Safely evaluate the input using ast.literal_eval
        result = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
        return f"Result: {result}"
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
        return "Invalid input. Please provide a valid Python expression."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`request.args.get('input', '')`:** Retrieves the `input` parameter from the query string of the request. If no input is provided, it defaults to an empty string.
2. **`ast.literal_eval`:** Safely evaluates a string containing a Python literal or container (e.g., numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.). It avoids executing arbitrary code, unlike `eval`.
3. **Error Handling:** Catches `ValueError` and `SyntaxError` for invalid inputs, and a generic `Exception` for any other unexpected errors.
4. **Flask App:** Runs the Flask app in debug mode for easier development and debugging.

### Example Usage:
Start the Flask app and visit the following URL in your browser or use a tool like `curl`:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?input=[1,2,3]
```
The response will be:
```
Result: [1, 2, 3]
```

**Important Note:** Even with `ast.literal_eval`, always validate and sanitize user input appropriately, especially in production environments.
