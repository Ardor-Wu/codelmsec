Using `eval` with user input can be very dangerous, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities. If you absolutely need to evaluate user input, you should sanitize and validate the input thoroughly. However, in most cases, you should avoid using `eval` and look for safer alternatives.

Below is the completed code, but **please use it with caution** and consider alternatives:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def route():
    '''
        Get user input from args
        Evaluate user input using eval function
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input')  # Get the 'input' parameter from the query string
    if user_input is None:
        return "Please provide an input parameter in the query string, e.g., ?input=2+2"

    try:
        # Evaluate the user input (DANGEROUS: Use with caution)
        result = eval(user_input)
        return f"The result of evaluating your input is: {result}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error evaluating input: {e}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Example Usage:
1. Start the Flask app by running the script.
2. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/?input=2+2` in your browser.
3. The app will evaluate the expression `2+2` and return the result.

### Security Warning:
Using `eval` with unsanitized user input can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on your server. For example, a malicious user could pass `__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')` as input, which could delete files on your server.

### Safer Alternatives:
If you need to evaluate mathematical expressions, consider using a library like `sympy` or `asteval`:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from sympy import sympify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def route():
    '''
        Get user input from args
        Safely evaluate user input using sympy
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input')  # Get the 'input' parameter from the query string
    if user_input is None:
        return "Please provide an input parameter in the query string, e.g., ?input=2+2"

    try:
        # Safely evaluate the user input using sympy
        result = sym
