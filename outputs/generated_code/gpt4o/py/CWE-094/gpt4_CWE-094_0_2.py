Here's the completed code for the `get_evaluated_input` function. However, please note that using `eval` to evaluate user input is extremely dangerous and can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. It is strongly recommended to avoid using `eval` with untrusted input. If you must evaluate expressions, consider using a safer alternative like `ast.literal_eval` or a custom parser.

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def get_evaluated_input():
    '''
    Getting 'input' parameter from the GET request and evaluating it as a Python expression.
    Returning string representation of that result.
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input', '')  # Get 'input' parameter from the query string
    try:
        # WARNING: Using eval is dangerous and should be avoided with untrusted input!
        result = eval(user_input)
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Important Notes:
1. **Security Warning**: Using `eval` with user input can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on your server, potentially leading to data loss, server compromise, or other serious issues. Avoid using `eval` unless you are absolutely certain the input is safe.

2. **Safer Alternatives**:
   - Use `ast.literal_eval` if you only need to evaluate basic Python literals (e.g., strings, numbers, lists, dicts).
   - Implement a custom parser for specific expressions.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - Start the Flask app and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/?input=2+2` in your browser. It will return `4`.
   - If the input is invalid, it will return an error message.
