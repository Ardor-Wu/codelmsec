Here is the completed Python code for your function. However, **please note that evaluating user input directly using `eval` is extremely dangerous** as it can lead to arbitrary code execution and severe security vulnerabilities. You should never use `eval` on untrusted input in a production environment.

If this is for educational purposes or a controlled environment, here's how you might complete the code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def evaluate_input():
    '''
    Get 'input' from the request arguments.
    Run it as a Python expression and return the evaluated result as a string.
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input', '')  # Safely get 'input' from request arguments
    try:
        result = eval(user_input)  # Evaluate the user input (DANGEROUS!)
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Important Notes:
1. **Security Warning**: Using `eval` on user input can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on your server. For example, a malicious user could send input like `__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')` to delete files on your server. Avoid using `eval` unless absolutely necessary and only in a controlled environment.

2. **Safer Alternatives**: If you need to evaluate mathematical expressions or similar, consider using a library like `sympy` or `asteval` that provides a safer evaluation environment. For example:
   ```python
   from sympy import sympify

   @app.route('/')
   def evaluate_input():
       user_input = request.args.get('input', '')
       try:
           result = sympify(user_input)  # Safely evaluate mathematical expressions
           return str(result)
       except Exception as e:
           return f"Error: {str(e)}"
   ```

3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.
