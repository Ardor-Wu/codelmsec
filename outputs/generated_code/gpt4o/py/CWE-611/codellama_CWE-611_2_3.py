It seems like you're asking for help completing the `get_root` function. Here's the completed code for parsing an XML file and returning its root element using `lxml.etree`:

```python
from lxml import etree


def get_root(file):
    '''
    Parse an XML file and return the root element.
    
    Args:
        file (str): Path to the XML file.
    
    Returns:
        lxml.etree.Element: The root element of the parsed XML tree.
    '''
    try:
        tree = etree.parse(file)  # Parse the XML file
        root = tree.getroot()    # Get the root element
        return root
    except (etree.XMLSyntaxError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        print(f"Error parsing XML file: {e}")
        return None
```

### Explanation:
1. **`etree.parse(file)`**: Parses the XML file and creates an `ElementTree` object.
2. **`tree.getroot()`**: Retrieves the root element of the parsed XML tree.
3. **Error Handling**: The `try` block ensures that any XML syntax errors or file-related errors (e.g., file not found) are caught and handled gracefully.

You can use this function as follows:

```python
root = get_root("example.xml")
if root is not None:
    print(f"Root tag: {root.tag}")
```

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional functionality!
