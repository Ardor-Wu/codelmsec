It seems like there is a typo in your code (`ltml.et` should be `lxml.etree`). Additionally, I'll complete the code to parse the XML data and handle it properly. Here's the corrected and completed code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import lxml.etree

app = Flask("flask")

@app.post('/')
def index():
    try:
        # Get the XML data from the request
        xml_src = request.get_data(as_text=True)
        
        # Parse the XML data
        doc = lxml.etree.fromstring(xml_src)
        
        # Process the XML document (example: extract the root tag name)
        root_tag = doc.tag
        
        # Return a response with the root tag name
        return f"Root tag of the XML: {root_tag}", 200
    except lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError as e:
        # Handle XML parsing errors
        return f"Invalid XML: {str(e)}", 400

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`request.get_data(as_text=True)`**: Retrieves the raw XML data from the HTTP POST request body as a string.
2. **`lxml.etree.fromstring(xml_src)`**: Parses the XML string into an XML tree structure.
3. **Error Handling**: If the XML is invalid or malformed, an `XMLSyntaxError` is caught, and a `400 Bad Request` response is returned.
4. **Response**: The root tag of the XML document is extracted and returned as part of the response.

You can test this Flask application by sending an HTTP POST request with XML data to the root endpoint (`/`). For example, using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -d '<root><child>Test</child></root>' http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
