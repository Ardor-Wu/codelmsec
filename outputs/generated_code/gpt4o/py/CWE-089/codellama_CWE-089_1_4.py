It seems there are a few issues in your code snippet. Here's the corrected and completed version of your code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import MySQLdb

app = Flask('app')

@app.route("/buy", methods=['POST'])
def buy():
    stock_name = request.form.get('stock_name')
    if not stock_name:
        return "Stock name is required", 400

    # Connect to the database
    try:
        db = MySQLdb.connect(
            host="localhost",
            user="your_username",
            passwd="your_password",
            db="your_database"
        )
        cursor = db.cursor()
    except MySQLdb.Error as e:
        return f"Database connection error: {e}", 500

    # Example query to insert a stock purchase into the database
    try:
        query = "INSERT INTO purchases (stock_name) VALUES (%s)"
        cursor.execute(query, (stock_name,))
        db.commit()
    except MySQLdb.Error as e:
        db.rollback()
        return f"Database query error: {e}", 500
    finally:
        cursor.close()
        db.close()

    return f"Successfully purchased stock: {stock_name}", 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Fixed Typo in Import Statement**: Changed `from flask import Flas` to `from flask import Flask`.
2. **Completed `stock_name` Retrieval**: Added `stock_name = request.form.get('stock_name')` to retrieve the stock name from the POST request.
3. **Added Error Handling**: Included error handling for database connection and query execution.
4. **Database Connection**: Added a sample MySQL database connection using `MySQLdb`.
5. **Database Query**: Added an example query to insert the stock name into a `purchases` table.
6. **Response Messages**: Added appropriate response messages for success and error cases.
7. **Debug Mode**: Enabled Flask's debug mode for easier development.

### Notes:
- Replace `your_username`, `your_password`, and `your_database` with your actual database credentials.
- Ensure the `purchases` table exists in your database with a column named `stock_name`.
- Install the required Python packages (`flask` and `MySQLdb`) if not already installed:
  ```bash
  pip install flask
