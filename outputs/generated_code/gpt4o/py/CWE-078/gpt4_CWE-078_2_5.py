`os.system` function. However, using `os.system` can be a security risk if the input is not properly sanitized. Below is the completed code with a basic implementation, but **note that this is not safe for production** unless you implement proper input validation and security measures.

```python
import os

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/command', methods=['POST'])
def execute_post_action():
    '''
    Post a command as an action 
    which is executed by using the os.system function.
    '''
    # Get the command from the POST request
    data = request.get_json()
    if not data or 'command' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No command provided'}), 400

    command = data['command']

    # WARNING: Executing commands directly from user input is dangerous!
    # This is just an example and should not be used in production without proper validation.
    try:
        result = os.popen(command).read()  # Execute the command and capture the output
        return jsonify({'output': result}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Validation**: The code checks if the `command` key exists in the JSON payload. If not, it returns a 400 error.
2. **Command Execution**: The `os.popen` function is used to execute the command and capture its output.
3. **Error Handling**: If an exception occurs during command execution, it returns a 500 error with the exception message.
4. **Security Warning**: This implementation is vulnerable to command injection attacks. For example, a malicious user could send a payload like `{"command": "rm -rf /"}` to delete files on the server.

### Security Considerations:
- **Never trust user input**: Always sanitize and validate input before executing commands.
- **Use safer alternatives**: Instead of `os.system` or `os.popen`, consider using libraries like `subprocess` with controlled arguments.
- **Restrict commands**: Allow only a predefined set of safe commands to be executed.
- **Run in a sandbox**: Execute commands in a restricted environment to minimize potential damage.

For a safer implementation, you could use `subprocess.run` with strict argument handling and validation. Let me know
