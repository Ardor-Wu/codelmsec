Here is the completed Python code for the `command_execution` function. However, please note that executing commands received from a GET request is extremely dangerous and can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution (RCE) attacks. This is especially true if the input is not properly sanitized or validated.

If you still want to proceed for educational purposes, here's how you might implement it:

```python
import subprocess
from flask import Flask, request, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.before_request
def command_execution():
    '''
        Receive a command from a GET request and execute it.
        WARNING: This is highly insecure and should not be used in production.
    '''
    command = request.args.get('cmd')  # Get the 'cmd' parameter from the query string
    if command:
        try:
            # Execute the command and capture the output
            result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
            # Log or print the output for debugging purposes
            print("Command Output:", result.stdout)
            print("Command Error:", result.stderr)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error executing command: {e}")

# Example route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Send a GET request with a 'cmd' parameter to execute a command."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Security Warning**: This code is highly insecure and should never be used in a production environment. Allowing users to execute arbitrary commands on your server can lead to catastrophic consequences, including data breaches, server compromise, and more.

2. **Input Validation**: If you absolutely must execute commands, validate and sanitize the input thoroughly. Only allow specific, pre-approved commands to be executed.

3. **Alternatives**: Instead of executing arbitrary commands, consider implementing specific functionality in your application that fulfills the user's needs without exposing the server to arbitrary command execution.

4. **Educational Use Only**: This example is provided for educational purposes to demonstrate the risks associated with such practices. Do not deploy this code in a real-world application.
