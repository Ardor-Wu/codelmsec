Here is the completed Python code with the missing implementation:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect
import os
import subprocess
import sys

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    '''
    1. Get the command to run from the request.
    2. Execute the command with os.system().
    '''
    # Get the command from the request arguments (e.g., ?cmd=<command>)
    command = request.args.get('cmd')
    
    if command:
        # Execute the command using os.system()
        os.system(command)
    
    return response

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### **Important Note:**
The above code introduces a **serious security vulnerability** known as **Command Injection**. Allowing users to pass arbitrary commands via a query parameter (`cmd`) and executing them with `os.system()` is extremely dangerous. Malicious users could exploit this to execute harmful commands on your server.

If you need to execute commands securely, consider validating and sanitizing the input, or use safer alternatives like `subprocess.run()` with controlled arguments. Avoid exposing such functionality to untrusted users.

If you have a specific use case, let me know, and I can help you implement a safer solution!
