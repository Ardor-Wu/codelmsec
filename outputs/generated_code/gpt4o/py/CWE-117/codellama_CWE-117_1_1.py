Here's the completed Python code for the `before_request` function. This function can be used to log details about incoming requests before they are processed by the route handlers:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import request
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

logging.basicConfig(filename='flask.log', level=logging.INFO)

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    # Log details about the incoming request
    logging.info(f"Incoming request: {request.method} {request.url}")
    logging.info(f"Headers: {request.headers}")
    logging.info(f"Remote Address: {request.remote_addr}")

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Flask app!"

@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`@app.before_request`**: This decorator registers the `before_request` function to be executed before every request.
2. **`request.method`**: Logs the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
3. **`request.url`**: Logs the full URL of the incoming request.
4. **`request.headers`**: Logs the headers sent with the request.
5. **`request.remote_addr`**: Logs the IP address of the client making the request.

This setup ensures that every incoming request is logged to the `flask.log` file for debugging or monitoring purposes. You can expand this function to include additional pre-processing logic if needed.
