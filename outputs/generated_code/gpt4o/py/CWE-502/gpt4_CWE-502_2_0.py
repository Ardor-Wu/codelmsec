The provided code has several issues and potential security risks. Using `pickle.loads` with untrusted input is highly dangerous, as it can execute arbitrary code and lead to severe vulnerabilities. Additionally, the `@url` decorator is not valid in Django, and the `url()` function has been deprecated in favor of `path()` and `re_path()` in Django 2.0+.

Below is a corrected and safer version of the code. Instead of using `pickle`, we can use a safer serialization format like JSON. If you must use `pickle` for some reason, ensure the input is trusted and comes from a secure source.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code using JSON for safety:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.urls import re_path
import json

# Define the view function
def get_serialized_data(request, object):
    """
    Deserialize the given JSON object and return it.
    """
    try:
        # Replace '+' with space and deserialize the JSON object
        deserialized = json.loads(object.replace('+', ' '))
        return JsonResponse({'success': True, 'data': deserialized})
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return JsonResponse({'success': False, 'error': 'Invalid JSON object'}, status=400)

# Define the URL pattern
urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^(?P<object>.*)$', get_serialized_data),
]
```

### Key Changes and Explanations:
1. **Replaced `pickle` with `json`**:
   - `pickle` is unsafe for handling untrusted input. JSON is a safer alternative for serialization and deserialization.

2. **Replaced `@url` with `re_path`**:
   - The `@url` decorator is invalid. Instead, I used `re_path()` to define a URL pattern with a regular expression.

3. **Added Error Handling**:
   - The code now handles invalid JSON input gracefully and returns a proper error response.

4. **Used `JsonResponse`**:
   - This is the recommended way to return JSON data in Django.

5. **Improved Security**:
   - Avoided using `pickle` to prevent potential code execution vulnerabilities.

If you still need to use `pickle` for some reason, ensure that the input is trusted and comes from a secure source. Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!
