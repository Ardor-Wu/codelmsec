It seems like your code snippet is incomplete and has some issues. Here's a completed and corrected version of your code:

```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.http import JsonResponse, HttpResponseBadRequest
import pickle

def getPickleData(request, object_name):
    '''
    Retrieve object from URL parameter and load the pickled object
    '''
    try:
        # Retrieve the pickled data from the GET parameter
        pickled = request.GET.get(object_name)
        if not pickled:
            return HttpResponseBadRequest("No data provided for the specified object.")

        # Decode and unpickle the data
        pickled_bytes = bytes(pickled, 'utf-8')  # Convert string to bytes
        defoliated = pickle.loads(pickled_bytes)

        # Return the unpickled object as a JSON response
        return JsonResponse({'data': defoliated})
    except pickle.UnpicklingError:
        return HttpResponseBadRequest("Invalid pickled data.")
    except Exception as e:
        return HttpResponseBadRequest(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

### Key Points:
1. **Security Warning**: Using `pickle.loads` on untrusted data is **insecure** and can lead to arbitrary code execution. If the data is coming from user input, you should avoid using `pickle` and consider safer alternatives like `json` or `yaml`.

2. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling for missing data, invalid pickled data, and other exceptions.

3. **Response**: The function returns a `JsonResponse` with the unpickled data or an appropriate error message.

4. **URL Configuration**: You need to add this view to your Django URL configuration. For example:
   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from .views import getPickleData

   urlpatterns = [
       path('get-pickle-data/<str:object_name>/', getPickleData, name='get_pickle_data'),
   ]
   ```

If you have control over the data format, consider switching to a safer serialization format like JSON. Let me know if you need help with that!
