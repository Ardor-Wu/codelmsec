Here's the completed Python code for your Flask route:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.get('/pickle')
def get_pickle_data():
    '''
        Get pickled data from the request, unpickle it, and return it.
        :return: JSON response with unpickled data or an error message.
    '''
    try:
        # Get the pickled data from the request
        pickled_data = request.data
        
        # Unpickle the data
        unpickled_data = pickle.loads(pickled_data)
        
        # Return the unpickled data as a JSON response
        return jsonify({"success": True, "data": unpickled_data})
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle errors (e.g., invalid pickled data)
        return jsonify({"success": False, "error": str(e)}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`request.data`**: This retrieves the raw binary data sent in the request body.
2. **`pickle.loads`**: This function is used to deserialize (unpickle) the binary data into a Python object.
3. **Error Handling**: If the data is not valid pickled data, an exception will be raised, and the error message will be returned with a `400 Bad Request` status.
4. **`jsonify`**: Converts the response into a JSON format for the client.

### Usage:
- Send a POST request to `/pickle` with the pickled data in the request body.
- The server will unpickle the data and return it in JSON format.

### Security Note:
Be cautious when using `pickle.loads` with untrusted data, as it can execute arbitrary code and pose a security risk. If the data source is not trusted, consider using a safer serialization format like JSON or MessagePack.
