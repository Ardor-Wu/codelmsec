The provided code snippet has a few issues that need to be addressed. First, the `object` parameter in the `getPickleData` function is expected to be a pickled string, but it is not clear how this string is being passed in the request. Additionally, the function does not return a valid HTTP response, which is required in Django views.

Below is the corrected and completed code for the `urls.py` file, including the necessary imports, URL routing, and a proper Django view implementation:

```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.http import JsonResponse, HttpResponseBadRequest
import pickle
import base64

# View function to handle pickled data
def getPickleData(request, pickled_object):
    """
    Convert a pickled string back into an object and return it as JSON.
    """
    try:
        # Decode the base64-encoded pickled string
        decoded_data = base64.b64decode(pickled_object)
        
        # Unpickle the data
        unpickled_object = pickle.loads(decoded_data)
        
        # Return the unpickled object as a JSON response
        return JsonResponse({'data': unpickled_object})
    except (pickle.UnpicklingError, ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        # Handle errors during unpickling or decoding
        return HttpResponseBadRequest(f"Invalid pickled data: {str(e)}")

# URL patterns
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^get-pickle-data/(?P<pickled_object>.+)/$', getPickleData, name='get_pickle_data'),
]
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**:
   - Since pickled data may contain binary data, it is common to encode it in Base64 before passing it as a URL parameter. The `base64.b64decode` function is used to decode the Base64 string back into binary data before unpickling.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added error handling to catch exceptions that may occur during decoding or unpickling. If an error occurs, the function returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request response.

3. **JsonResponse**:
   - The unpickled object is returned as a JSON response using Django's `JsonResponse` class. This ensures the response is properly formatted for the client.

4. **URL Pattern**:
   - The URL pattern captures the `pickled_object` parameter from the URL and passes it to the `
