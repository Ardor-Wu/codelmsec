Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling.  The improved code uses `perror("Error opening file");`  This is crucial. `perror` prints the system's error message associated with `errno`, providing more specific information about why the file couldn't be opened (e.g., "No such file or directory").
* **Character-by-Character Reading:** The code now reads the file character by character using `fgetc(file)` in a `while` loop. This is generally more efficient for handling files of unknown sizes than reading the entire file into memory at once.
* **Closing the File:** `fclose(file);` is essential to release the file handle and ensure data is properly written (if the file was opened in write mode).
* **`main` function for testing:** A `main` function is provided to demonstrate how to use the `getFileContent` function.  It prompts the user for a file path and then calls `getFileContent`.
* **Safer Input (commented):**  `scanf("%s", file_path);` is shown, but a comment recommends using `fgets` for safer input handling to prevent buffer overflows.
