```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// This function reads and includes contents of the specific file
void includeFile(const char* filePath) {
    // Open the file in read mode
    FILE* file = fopen(filePath, "r");

    // Check if the file was opened successfully
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file"); // Print an error message including the reason
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // Exit the program with an error code
    }

    // Read and print the file contents character by character
    char ch;
    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {
        putchar(ch);
    }

    // Close the file
    fclose(file);
}

int main() {
    includeFile("example.txt"); // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```


This improved version includes:

* **Error Handling:** Checks if the file opened successfully using `file == NULL`.  If the file doesn't open, it uses `perror()` to print a descriptive error message (including the system's reason for the failure) and then exits gracefully with `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`. This prevents the program from crashing or continuing with unpredictable behavior.
* **Character-by-Character Reading:** Uses `fgetc()` to read the file one character at a time. This is generally more efficient for handling potentially large files and avoids needing to allocate large buffers.
* **`putchar()` for Output:** Uses `putchar()` to write the characters to the console. This is a simple and efficient way to output individual characters.
* **`fclose()`:** Closes the file with `fclose(file)` to release the file handle after it's no longer needed.  This is crucial for proper file handling.
* **Example Usage:**  The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the `includeFile()` function.  You'll need to create a file named `example.txt` in the same directory as your C code for this to work correctly.


Key improvements over simpler approaches:

* **Robustness:**  The error handling makes the code much more robust and less prone to crashes.
* **Efficiency:** Character-by-character reading avoids unnecessary memory allocation.
* **Cleanliness:**  `fclose()` ensures resources are properly
