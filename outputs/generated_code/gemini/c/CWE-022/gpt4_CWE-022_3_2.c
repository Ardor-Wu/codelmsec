This improved code addresses several potential issues:

1. **Error Handling:** It checks if the file was opened successfully. If `fopen` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist), it prints an error message using `perror` (which is more informative than just a generic error message) and returns to prevent further operations on a NULL file pointer.
2. **Line Buffer Size:** It uses `fgets` instead of `fscanf("%s", ...)` which is much safer. `fgets` prevents buffer overflow by reading at most `sizeof(line) - 1` characters.  You can adjust the size of the `line` buffer as needed for your expected line lengths.
3. **Newline Removal:** It removes the trailing newline character that `fgets` might include. This ensures clean tokenization.
4. **Clearer Output:** It prints the original line before tokenizing, making the output easier to understand.
5. **Example Usage:** The `main` function provides a clear example of how to call the `includeFile` function.  You'll need to create a file named `example.txt` in the same directory as your
