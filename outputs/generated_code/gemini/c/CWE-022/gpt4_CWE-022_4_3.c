```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void display_input_file_contents() {
    char input_filename[128];
    char data_path[256];
    FILE *fp;

    // Prompt the user to enter the file name
    printf("Enter the filename: ");
    // Read the entered filename
    scanf("%s", input_filename);


    // Construct the full path to the input file  (assuming it's in a "data" subdirectory)
    snprintf(data_path, sizeof(data_path), "data/%s", input_filename);


    // Open the file in read mode
    fp = fopen(data_path, "r");

    // Check if the file opened successfully
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file"); // Use perror for better error reporting
        return; 
    }

    // Read and display the file contents character by character
    char ch;
    while ((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) {
        putchar(ch);
    }

    // Close the file
    fclose(fp);
}

int main() {
    display_input_file_contents();
    return 0;
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a check using `fp == NULL` after `fopen()` to handle potential file opening errors. `perror("Error opening file");` provides a more descriptive error message, including the system's reason for the failure.
* **Path Construction:**  The code uses `snprintf` to safely construct the file path. This prevents potential buffer overflows if the filename is too long. It assumes the file is located in a "data" subdirectory relative to where the program is run.  You can adjust this path as needed.
* **Character-by-Character Reading:** Using `fgetc()` to read and `putchar()` to display ensures that the code handles all characters correctly, including special characters and newlines.
* **File Closing:** `fclose(fp)` is crucial to release the file resources after use.
* **`main` function:** A `main` function is included to demonstrate how to call `display_input_file_contents()`.
