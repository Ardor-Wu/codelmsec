Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  Uses `perror("Error opening file");` instead of a simple `printf`. `perror` provides more context about *why* the file couldn't be opened (e.g., "No such file or directory", "Permission denied").  This is crucial for debugging.
* **Character-by-Character Reading:**  Uses `fgetc` to read the file character by character, which is generally more efficient than reading line by line for arbitrary file content (especially if lines are very long).
* **`putchar` for Output:** Uses `putchar` to write the characters to the console. It's a simple and efficient way to output individual characters.
* **`fclose`:**  Closes the file with `fclose(file);` after reading.  This is essential for releasing the file handle and ensuring data is properly written to disk.
* **Command-Line Argument Handling:** The `main` function now correctly handles command-line arguments using `argc` and `argv`. It checks if the correct number of arguments (the program name and the filename) are provided and prints a usage message if not.  This makes the program more user-friendly.
* **Return Codes in `main`:** Uses appropriate return codes in `main`: `
