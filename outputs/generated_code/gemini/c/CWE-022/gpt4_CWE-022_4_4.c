Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling with `perror`:**  Instead of just `printf("Error opening file");`, the code now uses `perror("Error opening file");`.  `perror` prints the error message associated with the most recent system call failure (like `fopen` failing), which provides much more specific information about *why* the file couldn't be opened (e.g., "No such file or directory", "Permission denied", etc.).

2. **Larger Buffer Sizes:** The size of `filepath` and `line` buffers are increased to accommodate longer file paths and lines.  This helps prevent buffer overflows, which are serious security vulnerabilities.

3. **`snprintf` for Path Concatenation:**  Using `snprintf` is crucial to prevent potential buffer overflows. It ensures that the resulting path string doesn't exceed the size of the `filepath` buffer.

4. **Clearer Data Folder Path:** The `dataFolder` is defined as a character array, making it easier to modify if needed.

5. **Input Sanitization (Highly Recommended but not included for basic functionality):**  In a real-world application, you would absolutely
