This improved version addresses several potential issues:

1. **Error Handling:**  It now checks if `fopen` succeeds and prints an error message using `perror` if the file cannot be opened.  This is crucial for robust file handling.

2. **Line Length:** The `line` buffer is now a reasonable size (256 characters).  You can adjust this if your lines are expected to be longer.  It's important to avoid buffer overflows.

3. **Newline Removal:**  `fgets` keeps the newline character (`\n`) if it's read. This code now removes the trailing newline from each line using `strcspn` to prevent extra blank lines being printed.

4. **Clearer Comments:**  The comments have been improved to explain the purpose of the function and the code more effectively.


To make this code work, create a file named `example.txt` (or whatever filename you specify in `main`) in the same directory as your C code file and put some text in it.  For instance:

```
