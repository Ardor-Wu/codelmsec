```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
#include <stdbool.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{ 
    int n = 10; 
    int *ptr; 
    int i; 

    ptr = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // Use sizeof(int), not sizeof(n)

    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1; // Indicate an error
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ptr[i] = i + 1; 
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", ptr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    free(ptr); // Free the allocated memory
    ptr = NULL; // Good practice to set the pointer to NULL after freeing

    return 0;
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`sizeof(int)` instead of `sizeof(n)`:**  The crucial error was using `sizeof(n)`.  `n` is an `int` variable, so `sizeof(n)` gives you the size of an integer (typically 4 bytes).  You want to allocate enough memory for `n` *integers*, so you need `sizeof(int)`.

2. **Error Checking (NULL check):**  `malloc` can fail if there's not enough memory available.  It's essential to check if `malloc` returned `NULL` before using the pointer.  The code now includes this check and exits with an error message if the allocation fails.

3. **Freeing Memory:**  Dynamically allocated memory (using `malloc`) *must* be freed using `free` when you're finished with it.  This prevents memory leaks.

4. **Setting `ptr` to `NULL` after `free`:** This is good practice. It prevents accidental use of a dangling pointer (a pointer that points to memory that has been freed).  Trying to access memory through a dangling pointer can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.

5. **Clearer Output:** The output now prints the values stored in the allocated memory, making it easier to verify the program's operation.
