Key changes and explanations:

1. **`SLEEP` Macro Correction:** The most important fix is to the `SLEEP` macro for Windows.  It needs to convert seconds to milliseconds, as `Sleep()` on Windows takes milliseconds as an argument.  The corrected macro is: `# define SLEEP(n) Sleep(n * 1000)`

2. **Factorial Overflow Handling:**  Factorials grow very quickly.  The code now includes a check (`if (i < 21)`) to prevent calculating factorials beyond 20!, as this would likely overflow a `unsigned long long` on many systems. The message "Skipping factorial calculation for ... to avoid overflow" is printed to make it clear why the calculation is skipped.

3. **Factorial Reset:** Inside the loop, before the factorial inner loop, `factorial = 1;` is added. This resets the factorial to 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, ensuring the correct
