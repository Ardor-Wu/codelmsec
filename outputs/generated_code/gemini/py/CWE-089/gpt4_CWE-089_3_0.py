```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.db import connection

def display_user_info(username):
    '''
    Retrieves user information given their username.
    Extracts from the 'users' database table all data about a particular user.
    Sends SQL command "SELECT" via cursor execution. 
    '''
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", [username])
            row = cursor.fetchone()
            if row:
                return row  # Or format the row into a dictionary/object
            else:
                return None  # Or raise an exception if user not found
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle database errors appropriately (e.g., logging, returning an error message)
        print(f"Error retrieving user information: {e}")
        return None


# Example urlpatterns usage (you might adjust this part based on your needs):
urlpatterns = [
    # ... other url patterns
    # Assuming you have a view that uses display_user_info:
    # url(r'^user/(?P<username>\w+)/$', some_view_function, name='user_info'),  # Example
]


# Example usage of the function
user_info = display_user_info('john_doe')
if user_info:
    print(user_info)  # Example: Print the raw row data
    # Process/format the user_info as needed
else:
    print("User not found.")

```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential database errors. This is crucial for robust code.  It prints an error message (you might want to log this in a real application) and returns `None` to indicate failure.

2. **Parameterization:** The SQL query now uses parameterized queries (`%s` placeholder) and passes the `username` in a separate list.  This is **absolutely essential** to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. *Never* construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user input.

3. **Resource Management (with statement):** The `with connection.cursor() as cursor:` ensures the cursor is properly closed, even if errors occur. This is good practice for database interactions.
