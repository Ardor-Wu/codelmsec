Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes comprehensive error handling using `try...except` blocks. This catches potential `MySQLdb.Error` exceptions (database-related issues) and generic `Exception` for other unforeseen problems.  It's crucial to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages (or HTTP status codes) to the client.  Consider using a logging library for more robust error tracking in a production environment.
2. **Input Validation:** The code checks if the `email` parameter is provided. If not, it returns a 400 Bad Request error, which is the appropriate HTTP status code for missing required
