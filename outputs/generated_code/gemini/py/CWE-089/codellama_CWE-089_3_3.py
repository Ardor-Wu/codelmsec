Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential database errors (e.g., incorrect table name, connection issues). This prevents the application from crashing and provides a more user-friendly error message.

2. **User Not Found:** It handles the case where the provided `username` doesn't exist in the database.  It returns a 404 (Not Found) HTTP status code, which is the appropriate response in this situation.

3. **Data Presentation:** Instead of just printing the raw tuple, the code now converts the database result into a dictionary using `zip` and `cursor.description`. This makes it much easier to access individual fields by name and display them in a formatted way. It builds a simple HTML response to show the user's information.

4. **URL Pattern:**  The `urlpatterns` now uses a regular expression `r'^user/(?P<username>\w+)/$'`  which:
   - `^user/` matches URLs starting with "user/".
   - `(?P<username>\w+)` captures
