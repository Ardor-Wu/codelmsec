```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.db import connection

def remove_user(request, username):
    '''
    create a cursor to delete user info from users table
    '''
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE username = %s", [username])
        # Or, using a parameterized query for better security
        # cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE username = %(username)s", {'username': username})

```

**Explanation of Changes and Important Security Considerations:**

The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection.  Using string formatting (`%s`) directly with user-supplied input allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.  **Never** do this.

The corrected code uses parameterized queries.  There are two main ways to do this in Python's DB-API:

1. **Using positional parameters:**  `cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE username = %s", [username])`  The `%s` placeholder is replaced by the values in the list (or tuple) provided as the second argument.  The database driver handles escaping special characters correctly.

2. **Using named parameters:** `cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE username = %(username)s", {'username': username})` A dictionary is used to map parameter names to values.  This can improve readability, especially with complex queries.

**Why parameterized queries are essential:**

* **Security:** They prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  The database driver treats the parameters as data, not as executable code.
* **Performance:**  The database can often cache the query plan for parameterized queries, leading to faster execution.
* **Correctness:**  They handle special characters and data types correctly, avoiding unexpected errors or data corruption.


**Using Django's ORM:**

While the question specifically asks to use a cursor, in a Django project, it's generally recommended to use Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for database operations.  This is cleaner, more secure, and easier to maintain.  Here's how you would delete a user using the ORM:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User  # Assuming you're using Django's built-in User model

def remove_user(request, username):
    try:
        user = User.objects.get(username=username)
        user.delete
