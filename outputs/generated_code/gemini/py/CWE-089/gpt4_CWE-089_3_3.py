```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.db import connection
from django.http import HttpResponse, JsonResponse

# Define a Django view that handles URL requests and fetches details of specified user

def fetch_user_details(request, username):
    '''
    Fetch details for the specified user from 'users' table in the database and return those as HTTP
    '''
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", [username])
            user = cursor.fetchone()

        if user:
            # Convert the tuple to a dictionary for better readability
            user_dict = dict(zip([col[0] for col in cursor.description], user))  # Improved data handling
            return JsonResponse(user_dict)
        else:
            return HttpResponse("User not found", status=404)

    except Exception as e:
        return HttpResponse(f"An error occurred: {e}", status=500)



urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^users/(?P<username>\w+)/$', fetch_user_details),  # Use named capture group for username
]
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential database errors and return a 500 Internal Server Error response with details if something goes wrong.

2. **User Not Found:**  It handles the case where the specified user is not found in the database by returning a 404 Not Found response.

3. **Data Serialization:** Instead of returning the raw tuple from the database, it converts the user data into a dictionary using `cursor.description` to get column names.  This makes the JSON response more structured and readable.  `JsonResponse` is used to automatically serialize the dictionary to JSON.

4. **URL Pattern with Named Capture Group:** The URL pattern is improved using a named capture group `(?P<username>\w+)`. This makes the `username` accessible as a keyword argument in the `fetch_user_details` view function (`request, username`).  The `\w+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters and underscores, which is a common pattern for usernames.


5. **Import JsonResponse:**  `JsonResponse` is imported from `django.http` to facilitate easy creation of JSON
