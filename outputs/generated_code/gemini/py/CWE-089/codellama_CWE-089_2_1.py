```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.db import connection

from django.http import HttpResponse

def remove_user(request,username):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE username=%s", [username])
    return HttpResponse("User removed successfully")

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^remove_user/(?P<username>\w+)/$', remove_user),
]
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`connection.cursor()` as context manager:**  The original code was missing the crucial `cursor()` call and wasn't using the cursor as a context manager. Using `with connection.cursor() as cursor:` ensures proper resource management; the cursor and connection are automatically closed even if exceptions occur.
* **Parameterized query:** The original code used string formatting (`%s`) to build the SQL query.  This is highly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  The corrected code uses parameterized queries with placeholders (`%s`) and a separate list of parameters passed to `execute()`. This lets the database driver handle escaping special characters, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Removed `*` from DELETE:** The `DELETE *` syntax is non-standard SQL and might not be supported by all databases. The correct syntax for deleting rows is simply `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition`.
* **Return a response:** The original code didn't return any response.  The updated code returns an `HttpResponse` to indicate success.
* **Included `urlpatterns`:** Added a basic `urlpatterns` example to show how the `remove_user` view would be integrated into a Django project.  The regular expression captures the username as a named group `username` and passes it to the view function.  `\w+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters and underscores.


**Important Security Note:** While this code now uses parameterized queries and is much safer, directly manipulating the database from a view is generally discouraged in Django.  It's usually better to use Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for database operations.  The ORM provides a higher-level, more secure, and more convenient way to interact with the database, including built-in protection against SQL injection.

Example using Django ORM (preferred method):

```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import User  # Assuming you have
