```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect
import os
import subprocess
import sys

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ping')
def ping():
    url = request.args.get('url')
    if not url:
        return "Error: 'url' parameter is missing", 400

    try:
        # Sanitize input to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
        # Only allow pinging hostnames/IPs, not arbitrary commands.
        # This example uses a very basic approach; more robust solutions
        # might involve regular expressions or dedicated libraries.
        if not all(c.isalnum() or c in ['.', '-']):
            return "Error: Invalid characters in URL", 400


        # Construct the ping command.  Use a list to avoid shell injection.
        command = ["ping", "-c", "3", url]  # Limit to 3 pings

        # Execute the command and capture output
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True) #check=True raises exception on non-zero exit code


        return f"<pre>{result.stdout}</pre>"


    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"<pre>Error: {e.stderr}</pre>", 500 # Return stderr for debugging
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}", 500


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True) # ONLY for development.  Disable in production!
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Security:** The most critical change is the input sanitization.  The original code was extremely vulnerable to command injection.  This improved version checks for alphanumeric characters, periods, and hyphens, although a more robust regex or whitelist approach would be preferable in a real application.  We also use `subprocess.run` with a list argument to prevent shell injection.
* **Error Handling:**  The code now handles potential errors like an invalid URL, the ping command failing, or other unexpected issues. It returns appropriate status codes (400 for bad request, 500 for server error) and more informative error messages. The `stderr` from the `subprocess` call can help in debugging.
* **Limited Pings:**
