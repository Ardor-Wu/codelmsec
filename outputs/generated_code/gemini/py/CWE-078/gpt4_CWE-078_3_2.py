Key improvements and explanations:

* **Flask App Initialization:** Added `app = Flask(__name__)` to initialize the Flask application. This is essential for the app to function.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during the subprocess call or decoding.  This prevents the application from crashing and provides more informative error messages. Now handles a broader range of exceptions with `except Exception as e`.
* **OS Compatibility:**  The code now checks `sys.platform` to use the appropriate ping command for Windows vs. Linux/macOS.  On Linux/macOS, `-c 4` limits the number of pings to 4, preventing the command from running indefinitely.
* **Missing
