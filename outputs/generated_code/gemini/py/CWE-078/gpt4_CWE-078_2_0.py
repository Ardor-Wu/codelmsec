**Explanation and crucial security warnings:**

The provided code snippet is **extremely dangerous** and should **never** be used in a production environment or any publicly accessible system.  It directly executes shell commands received from a POST request without any sanitization or validation.  This opens the door to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to completely compromise the server.

**Why this is dangerous:**

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can send any command they want, including commands to delete files, steal data, install malware, or gain full control of the server.
* **No Sanitization:** The `action` parameter is used directly without any checks or filtering. This means any special characters or malicious commands will be executed as-is.
* **No Authentication/Authorization:**  Anyone can send a POST request to this endpoint.  There's no mechanism to verify the identity or permissions of the requester.

**How to fix this (if you absolutely must execute external commands):**

If you absolutely must execute external commands based on user input (which is generally discouraged), you should take extreme precautions:

1. **Sanitize Input:**  Strictly sanitize and validate the input.  Only allow specific, pre-defined commands or carefully filter the input to remove potentially harmful characters.  Consider using a whitelist approach.
2. **Use `subprocess` Safely:** Instead of `os.system`, use the `subprocess` module with appropriate arguments to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.  For example:

   ```python
   import subprocess

   safe_command = ['ls', '-l']  #
