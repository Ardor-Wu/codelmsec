Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handle GET requests:**  Added `if request.method == 'GET':` to ensure the logging only happens for GET requests, which is standard for capturing URLs visited in a browser.

2. **Error Handling:**  Replaced `os.system` with `subprocess.run(check=True)`. This is crucial.  `os.system` doesn't give you good error handling.  `check=True` will raise a `subprocess.CalledProcessError` if the `log_url.py` script exits with a non-zero exit code, allowing you to handle errors properly.

3. **Error Logging:**  Added `print(f"Error executing
