Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes comprehensive error handling using `try...except` blocks.  It handles `subprocess.CalledProcessError` (for ping failures), `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, and general exceptions. This provides more robust and informative error messages.
* **Timeout:** A timeout is added to the `subprocess.check_output` call to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely if the ping takes too long.
* **OS Compatibility Consideration:** Includes example
