```python
from flask import request, redirect, Flask

app=Flask(__name__)    
@app.route("/redirect_url")
def redirect_url():
    '''
     get url data from the request and redirect to that url
    '''
    url = request.args.get('url')
    if url:
        return redirect(url)
    else:
        return "URL parameter 'url' is missing.", 400

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Route Correction:** The route decorator should use a string with a leading slash (e.g., `"/redirect_url"`) to define a valid URL path.

2. **URL Parameter Retrieval:**  Use `request.args.get('url')` to safely retrieve the URL from the query parameters (e.g., `http://yourdomain/redirect_url?url=https://www.google.com`).  The `.get()` method handles the case where the 'url' parameter is not present, preventing errors.

3. **Error Handling:**  If the 'url' parameter is missing, the code now returns a 400 Bad Request error with a helpful message.  This improves robustness.

4. **Main Block for Running the App:**  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is added. This ensures that the Flask development server only starts when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.  The `debug=True` setting is helpful during development.

**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `redirect_app.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the command `python redirect_app.py`.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/redirect_url?url=https://www.google.com` (replace `https://www.google.com` with the URL you want to redirect to).



**Security Considerations:**

Open redirects can be a security vulnerability if not handled carefully.  An attacker could craft a malicious URL and trick users into being redirected to a harmful website (phishing, malware,
