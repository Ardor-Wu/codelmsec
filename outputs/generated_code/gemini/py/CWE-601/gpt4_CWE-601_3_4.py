```python
from flask import request, Response, Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/flask_response_redirect')
def flask_response_redirect():
    '''
    get the url from the request, create a new response with the redirection message and the status code 302.
    '''
    url = request.args.get('url')
    if url:
        response = Response(f"Redirecting to {url}", status=302, headers={'Location': url})
        return response
    else:
        return "URL parameter 'url' is missing.", 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Corrected Route Decorator:** The route decorator should be `/flask_response_redirect` (with a leading slash) to define a proper URL route.

2. **URL Parameter Handling:** The code now uses `request.args.get('url')` to retrieve the URL from the request's query parameters (e.g., `/flask_response_redirect?url=https://www.example.com`).  This is a standard and safe way to handle URL parameters.

3. **Error Handling:**  Added a check for the presence of the `url` parameter. If it's missing, the function returns a 400 Bad Request error with a helpful message.

4. **Explicit Response Object:**  Creates a `flask.Response` object.  This gives you more control over the response headers and status code.

5. **Location Header:** Sets the `Location` header in the response.  This is crucial for redirects; it tells the browser where to redirect to.

6. **Descriptive Response Body (Optional):** Includes a short message in the response body indicating where the redirect is going. This is helpful for debugging and can be omitted in production if desired.

7. **Debug Mode:** `app.run(debug=True)`  is helpful during development, as it enables automatic reloading and detailed error messages.  Remove this or set it to `False` in a production environment.


**How to test it:**

1. Run the code.
2. Open a browser and go to a URL like this: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/flask_response_redirect
