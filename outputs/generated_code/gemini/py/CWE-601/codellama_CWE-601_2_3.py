```python
from flask import request, redirect, Flask

app=Flask(__name__)  
@app.route("/redirect")
def redirection():
    '''
     get the url data from the request
     and redirect to it.
    '''
    url = request.args.get('url')
    if url:
        return redirect(url)
    else:
        return "No URL provided", 400

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Route Correction:** The route decorator should use a string literal, so it's changed to `@app.route("/redirect")`.

2. **URL Retrieval:**  The code now uses `request.args.get('url')` to retrieve the URL from the query parameters. This is the standard way to handle GET parameters in Flask.  For example, a user would access this route like: `http://yourserver/redirect?url=https://www.google.com`.

3. **Error Handling:**  If the `url` parameter is missing, the function returns a 400 Bad Request error with a helpful message. This prevents unexpected behavior.

4. **Testable with `if __name__ == "__main__":`:** The inclusion of `if __name__ == "__main__":` block allows you to run the Flask development server when you execute the script directly (e.g., `python your_script.py`).  This is standard practice for Flask applications.  The `debug=True` setting is helpful for development, as it enables automatic reloading and detailed error messages.


**How to run this code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `redirect_app.py`).
2. **Run:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run `python redirect_app.py`.
3. **Test:** Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/redirect?url=https://www.google.com` (replace `https://www.google.com` with the URL you want to redirect to).  You should be redirected to that URL.  Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:5000/redirect` without
