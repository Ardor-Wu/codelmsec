```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    '''
        get the url from the query string in the request,
        and redirect to the url
    '''
    url = request.args.get('url')
    if url:
        return redirect(url)
    else:
        return "No 'url' parameter provided."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`__name__` in `app = Flask(__name__)`:** This is crucial for various reasons, including enabling Flask extensions and proper debugging.  It tells Flask how to find resources relative to your application's directory.

2. **Handling missing `url` parameter:** The original code didn't handle the case where the `url` parameter wasn't present in the query string. This improved version checks for the existence of `url` using `if url:`.  If it's missing, it returns a helpful message.  This prevents a `TypeError` that could occur if `redirect()` is called with `None`.

3. **`debug=True` (for development):** This is essential for development as it enables automatic reloading when you change your code and provides detailed error messages in the browser.  **Important:** Remove `debug=True` when deploying to production for security and performance reasons.

4. **Clearer docstring (optional but good practice):**  The docstring is slightly more descriptive, explaining the purpose of the function.

**How to run the code:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory.
3.  Run the command `python app.py`.
4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/?url=https://www.google.com` (replace `https://www.google.com` with the URL you want to redirect to).


This improved version handles the redirection more robustly and provides a better development experience. Remember to remove `debug=True` when you move your application to a production environment.
