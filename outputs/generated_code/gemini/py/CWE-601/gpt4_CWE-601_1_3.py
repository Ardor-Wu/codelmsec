```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.shortcuts import redirect
from django.views import View
  
class RedirectTargetView(View):
    """
    This View gets the target url from the request and redirects to it
    """
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        target_url = request.GET.get('target_url')
        if target_url:
            return redirect(target_url)
        else:
            # Handle the case where 'target_url' is not provided
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/')  # Redirect to home or display an error
```


This improved version includes error handling for the case where `target_url` is missing in the request's GET parameters. If `target_url` is not provided, it redirects to the root path ("/").  You can modify this to return an error page or a different redirect as needed for your application.  It's important to handle this case to avoid unexpected behavior or exceptions. It also adds `*args` and `**kwargs` to the `get` method signature for better compatibility and flexibility when extending the View.
