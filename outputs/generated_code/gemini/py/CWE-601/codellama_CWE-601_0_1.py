```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/redirect')
def redirect_to_target():
    '''
        get the target url from request and redirect to it with the http code 30
    '''
    target_url = request.args.get('target')
    if target_url:
        try:
            # Assuming you want 302 (Found/Temporary Redirect) which is the default for redirect()
            # or 307 (Temporary Redirect - preserving method) are the most likely intended codes.
            # 301 (Moved Permanently) is less common in this context.  
            # You'll need to be explicit if you want something other than 302.
            
            # For 302:
            return redirect(target_url)  

            # For 307:
            # return redirect(target_url, code=307)

            # For 301:
            # return redirect(target_url, code=301)


        except Exception as e: # Catching broadly is generally bad practice, be more specific if possible
            return f"Error redirecting: {e}", 500  # Indicate an error
    else:
        return "Target URL not provided", 400 # Indicate bad request

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # debug=True is for development only!
```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during redirection (e.g., invalid URLs).  It returns a 500 error code along with a message if redirection fails.
* **Missing Target Handling:** It checks if `target_url` is provided. If not, it returns a 400 error code (Bad Request) indicating that the required parameter is missing.
* **HTTP Status Codes:**  The code uses `redirect()` which defaults to a 302 redirect. I've also shown how to explicitly set 307 and 301 if those are your intended redirect types.  The status code helps the client (browser) understand the nature of the redirect.
* **`if __name__ == '__main__':`
