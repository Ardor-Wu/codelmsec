```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect

app = Flask('my_app')

@app.route('/redirector')
def http_redirect():
    target = request.args.get('target')  # Use request.args.get to safely handle missing parameters
    if target:
        return redirect(location=target, code=302) # Default to 302 or specify other codes like 301, 307, etc. as needed
    else:
        return "Target parameter missing", 400  # Return an error if the target is not provided
```

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Safe Parameter Handling:**  Instead of directly accessing `request['target']`, we use `request.args.get('target')`.  This is crucial because if the `target` parameter isn't present in the URL, the original code would raise a `KeyError`.  `request.args.get()` gracefully returns `None` if the key is missing.

2. **Handling Missing Target:** The code now checks if `target` is truthy (not None or an empty string). If `target` is missing, it returns a 400 Bad Request error along with a helpful message.  This is important for robust error handling.

3. **Explicit Redirect Code:** The code now explicitly uses `code=302`. While 302 (Found/Temporary Redirect) is the default in Flask, it's best practice to be explicit for clarity and maintainability. If you need a different redirect type (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 307 Temporary Redirect, 308 Permanent Redirect), specify the appropriate code here.  This ensures that clients and search engines interpret the redirect correctly.


**Example Usage:**

* **Redirect to Google:** `/redirector?target=https://www.google.com`
* **Missing Target:** `/redirector` (will result in a 400 error)
* **Redirect to a relative URL (within your application):** `/redirector?target=/another_page`


**Important Security Consideration: Open Redirects**

Be very cautious about allowing users to control the redirection target directly.  The code, as written, is vulnerable to open redirects, a security flaw that could allow attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.

To mitigate this risk,
