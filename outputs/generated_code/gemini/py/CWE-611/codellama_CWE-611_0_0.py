```python
from flask import Flask, request
import lxml.etree

app = Flask('')

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def check():
    '''
    1. get the xml from the request
    2. parse it
    3. check if the element <status> exists and its text equals 'OK'
    4. return "OK" if the condition is met, otherwise return "BAD"
    '''
    try:
        xml_data = request.data
        root = lxml.etree.fromstring(xml_data)
        status_element = root.find('.//status')  # Use XPath to find the status element anywhere in the XML

        if status_element is not None and status_element.text == 'OK':
            return "OK"
        else:
            return "BAD"
    except lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError:  # Handle invalid XML
        return "BAD"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)

```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential `lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError` exceptions.  This is crucial because if the incoming data isn't valid XML, the `lxml.etree.fromstring()` function will raise an error.  Catching this error prevents the application from crashing and allows it to return "BAD" as expected.
* **XPath for Element Finding:**  Instead of assuming a specific structure for the XML, the code uses `root.find('.//status')`. This XPath expression searches for the `<status>` element anywhere within the XML document, making the function more robust to variations in the XML structure.
* **Explicit Check for `None`:** The code explicitly checks if `status_element` is `None` before accessing its `text` attribute.  This is a necessary safeguard to avoid `AttributeError` if the `<status>` element is not found.
* **Runnable Example:** The inclusion of `if __name__ == '__main__':` and `app.run()` allows you to directly run the code as a Flask application. The `host='0.0.0.0'` makes the app accessible from any network interface, and `port=808
