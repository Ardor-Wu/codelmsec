Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Flask App Initialization:**  Added `app = Flask(__name__)` to create a Flask application instance. This is essential for the route decorator to work.

2. **Error Handling:**  Included a `try...except` block to handle potential errors:
   - `lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError`: Catches errors in XML parsing.
   - `Exception as e`:  A general exception handler for other unexpected issues. It's crucial to include comprehensive error handling in production code.  Logging the error (e.g., using Python's `logging` module) would be highly recommended.

3. **Status Codes:**
