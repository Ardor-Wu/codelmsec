```python

@app.route("/login", methods=['POST'])
def login():
    '''
        get the xml_src, parse it, check the userid and password and return
    '''
    try:
        xml_src = request.data
        root = lxml.etree.fromstring(xml_src)

        userid = root.find("userid").text
        password = root.find("password").text

        if userid == "admin" and password == "password":
            return "Login successful", 200
        else:
            return "Invalid credentials", 401

    except (lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError, AttributeError):
        return "Invalid XML format", 400

if __name__ == "__main__":

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`app = Flask(__name__)`**:  The Flask constructor takes the name of the current module (`__name__`) as an argument. This is important for various reasons, including allowing Flask to find templates and static files.

* **Error Handling (try...except block):** The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors:
    * **`lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError`**: Catches errors if the provided XML is malformed.
    * **`AttributeError`**: Catches errors if the XML doesn't contain the expected `userid` or `password` elements (e.g., if `root.find("userid")` returns `None` and then you try to access its `.text` attribute).
    * This makes the code more robust and provides more informative error messages to the client.

* **Specific Status Codes:**  The code now uses appropriate HTTP status codes:
    * `200 OK`:  For successful login.
    * `401 Unauthorized`: For incorrect credentials.
    * `400 Bad Request`: For invalid XML format.

* **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** This is standard practice in Python.  It ensures that the `app.run()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module). This prevents accidental running of the Flask development server if the module
