```python
from flask import Flask, request
import lxml.etree

app = Flask("flask")

@app.post('/')
def index():
    xml_src = request.get_data(as_text=True)
    try:
        doc = lxml.etree.fromstring(xml_src.encode())  # Encode to bytes for lxml
        # Example: Extract and return a specific element's text
        element_text = doc.xpath("//some_element")[0].text # Example XPath, adjust as needed
        return element_text, 200

    except lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError as e:
        return f"Invalid XML: {e}", 400
    except IndexError:
        return "Element not found", 400
    except Exception as e: # Catch other potential errors
        return f"An error occurred: {e}", 500


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Encoding for lxml:** `lxml.etree.fromstring()` expects bytes, not a string.  We encode the `xml_src` using `.encode()` before passing it to `fromstring()`.

2. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors:
   - `lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError`: Catches invalid XML input and returns a 400 Bad Request error.
   - `IndexError`:  Handles cases where the XPath expression doesn't find the desired element.  This prevents the code from crashing if the element isn't present.
   - `Exception`: A general exception handler to catch other unexpected errors and return a 500 Internal Server Error.  This is good practice for production code.  In development, you might want to print the exception for debugging:  `print(e)`

3. **XPath Example:** I've added an example of how to extract data using XPath. You'll need to replace `"//some_element"` with the correct XPath expression to target the specific element you want to retrieve.  XPath is a powerful way to navigate XML documents.

4. **Return Value and Status Codes:** The function now returns meaningful responses and appropriate HTTP status codes:
   - 200 OK: If
