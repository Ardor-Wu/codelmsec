    '''
    xml_src = request.get_data()
    try:
        doc = lxml.etree.fromstring(xml_src)
        xml_string = lxml.etree.tostring(doc, pretty_print=True, encoding="UTF-8", xml_declaration=True).decode()
        return xml_string
    except lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError as e:
        return f"Invalid XML: {e}", 400

Key improvements:

* **`app = Flask(__name__)`:**  This crucial line was missing. It creates the Flask application instance. Without it, the `@app.route` decorator wouldn't work.
* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential `lxml.etree.XMLSyntaxError` if the input XML is invalid. This prevents the application from crashing and provides a more informative error message to the user.  A generic `Exception` handler is also included to catch other unforeseen errors.
* **Decoding to String:**  `lxml.etree.tostring()` returns a byte string.  The code now decodes this to a regular string using `.decode("UTF-8")` so Flask can handle the response correctly.
* **Pretty Printing and XML Declaration:** The `pretty_print=True` argument formats the XML output nicely for readability. `xml_declaration=True` adds the XML declaration (`<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>`) to the output.
* **UTF-8 Encoding:** Explicitly setting `encoding="UTF-8"` ensures consistent character encoding.
* **Return Codes:**  The error handling returns appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for bad request, 500 for internal server error).
* **Runnable Example:** The addition of `if __name__ == "__main__":` and `app
