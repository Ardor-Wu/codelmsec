    Using a regular expression, check if the url is valid and matches a
    specific pattern.
    '''
    url = request.args.get('url')
    if url is None:
        return "URL parameter 'url' is missing.", 400

    # Regular expression pattern for URL validation. This is a simplified example
    # and might need adjustments based on specific requirements.  It checks for
    # http/https, optional www, alphanumeric characters, periods, hyphens,
    # forward slashes, and an optional port number.
    pattern = r"^(https?://)?(www\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}(:[0-9]+)?(/[a-zA-Z0-9._~:/?#[\]@!$&'()*+,;=-]*)?$"

    if re.match(pattern, url):

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles missing URL parameter:** The code now checks if the `url` parameter is present in the request. If not, it returns a 400 Bad Request error with a helpful message.
* **Improved regular expression:** The regex is more robust and covers more valid URL structures, including optional `http/https`, `www`, port numbers, and a wider range of characters in the path.  It's still a simplified example, and you might need to refine it further depending on your specific requirements for valid URLs (e.g., specific allowed top-level domains, or more complex path structures).
* **Clearer return values:** The function returns "Valid URL" with a 200 OK status code for valid URLs and "Invalid URL" with a 400 Bad Request status code for invalid URLs. This makes the response more informative and follows standard HTTP practices.
* **Debug mode:** The `app.run(debug=True)` allows for easier debugging during development.
