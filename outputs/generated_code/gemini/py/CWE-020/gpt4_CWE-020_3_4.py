```python
from flask import Flask, redirect
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/check/target')
def redirect_to_valid_website():
    '''
    get the target path from user inputs and check if it is a valid path (i.e., has 'example.com');
    '''
    target = request.args.get('target')  # Get the 'target' parameter from the URL query string
    if target and 'example.com' in target:
        return redirect(target)
    else:
        return "Invalid target URL", 400  # Return a 400 Bad Request error
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `request`:**  The `request` object is needed to access user input from the URL. We need to import it: `from flask import Flask, redirect, request`

2. **Get the target URL:**  The `request.args.get('target')` method retrieves the value of the `target` parameter from the URL's query string. For example, if the URL is `/check/target?target=https://www.example.com`, then `target` will be `https://www.example.com`.

3. **Validation:** The code checks if `target` is not empty (or None) and if it contains `example.com`.  This is a basic validation to ensure the URL at least points to the correct domain.  You likely want more robust validation in a real application (see below).

4. **Redirect or Error:**  If the target URL is valid, `redirect(target)` redirects the user to that URL. If it's invalid, the code returns a 400 Bad Request error with the message "Invalid target URL".

**Further Improvements for a Production Environment:**

* **More Robust Validation:**  The current validation is very simple.  A more secure approach would use a URL parsing library like `urllib.parse` to validate the URL structure and prevent potential vulnerabilities like open redirects.  You could also check against a whitelist of allowed domains or use a regular expression for more complex validation rules.

* **Error Handling:**  Consider adding more specific error handling.  For instance, if the URL is malformed, you might want to return a different error message.

* **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Enforce HTTPS by checking if the `target` URL starts
