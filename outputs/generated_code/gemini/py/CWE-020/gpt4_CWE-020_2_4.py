```python
from flask import Flask, redirect
import re
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/app')
def redirect_to_valid_host(target):
    '''
    Check if the target contains a valid hostname (either www.example.com or beta.example.com)
    If so, then redirect
    '''
    valid_hosts = ["www.example.com", "beta.example.com"]
    if target in valid_hosts:
        return redirect(f"https://{target}")
    else:
        return "Invalid host", 400


# The following lines are needed to run the Flask app locally for testing.
# In a real deployment, these wouldn't be necessary as a WSGI server
# like Gunicorn or uWSGI would handle running the app.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Target Parameter:** The original code lacked a way to receive the `target` hostname.  A Flask route needs a mechanism to accept the target.  While there are multiple ways to achieve this (query parameters, path variables), the simplest for demonstration is to make `target` a query parameter. To access it you would use `request.args.get('target')`. I've added example usage in the code below.

2. **Valid Host Check:**  The code now explicitly checks if the provided `target` is in the `valid_hosts` list. This is more secure and efficient than using a regular expression for such a simple case.

3. **Redirect with HTTPS:**  The redirect now uses `https://` to ensure a secure connection.

4. **Error Handling:** If the host is invalid, the code now returns a 400 Bad Request error along with a message.  This provides better feedback to the client.


**Example Usage (with query parameter):**

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, request
import re
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/app')
def redirect_to_valid_host():
    target = request.args.get('target')  # Get target from query parameter
    valid_hosts = ["www.example.com", "beta.example.com"]
    if target in valid_hosts:
        return redirect(f"https
