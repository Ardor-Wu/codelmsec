```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, request, url_for
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/redirect')
def target_redirection():
    '''
    Fetch 'target' from request arguments
    Check if "example.com" is part of the 'target'
    If condition is
    '''
    target = request.args.get('target')

    if target and "example.com" in target:
        return f"Redirecting to: {target} is not allowed"  # Or handle it differently, e.g., log and redirect to a safe page
    elif target:
        return redirect(target)
    else:
        return "No 'target' parameter provided."


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Import `request`:** The `request` object is essential for accessing URL parameters.  The original code was missing this import.

2. **Handle missing `target`:** The code now checks if `target` exists at all before trying to use it. This prevents errors if the user accesses `/redirect` without a `target` parameter.  It returns a clear message to the user.

3. **Explicitly check for `example.com`:** The prompt requested a check for "example.com".  This implementation directly uses `in` to perform a substring check.  This makes the intent clear.

4. **Security consideration (important!):** Redirecting user input directly is a major security vulnerability (Open Redirect). This example includes a check for `example.com` as per the instructions, but in a real application, you should **never** directly redirect to a URL provided by the user without very careful validation.  The example shows how to prevent redirection to a specific domain, but a more robust solution would involve a whitelist of allowed domains or a completely different approach (like generating redirects on the server-side based on internal logic).


5. **Return a message if redirect to example.com is attempted:** Instead of silently failing or redirecting to a default page, the code now returns a message indicating that redirection to example.com is not allowed when the condition is met.  This is a simple way to handle it; you might prefer logging the attempt or using a different strategy.


6. **`url_for` (Optional but recommended):
