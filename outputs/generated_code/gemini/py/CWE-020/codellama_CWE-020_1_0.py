```python
import base64
import pickle
from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/app")
def redirect_it():
    '''
    decode the request data, then deserialize it
    '''
    try:
        data = request.args.get('data')
        if not data:
            return "No data provided", 400

        decoded_data = base64.b64decode(data)
        deserialized_data = pickle.loads(decoded_data)
        return str(deserialized_data), 200
    except (base64.binascii.Error, pickle.UnpicklingError, EOFError) as e:
        return f"Error decoding or deserializing data: {e}", 400

```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential errors during decoding and deserialization. This is crucial for security and robustness. It handles `base64.binascii.Error` for base64 decoding issues, `pickle.UnpicklingError` and `EOFError` for pickle deserialization problems.  It returns a 400 Bad Request error with a descriptive message if an error occurs.
* **Input Validation:** It checks if the 'data' parameter is present in the request.  If not, it returns a 400 Bad Request with a clear message. This prevents the code from trying to decode and deserialize `None`, which would cause an error.
* **Clear Return Values:** It returns the deserialized data as a string with a 200 OK status code on success. This makes the API more predictable and easier to use.
* **Security Considerations:**  While this code provides basic functionality, using `pickle` for deserializing data from untrusted sources is **highly dangerous**.  `pickle` can execute arbitrary code if the input data is maliciously crafted.  If you are receiving data from external sources, consider using a safer serialization format like JSON.


Example Usage (with curl):

```bash
# Serialize a simple dictionary
python -c 'import pickle, base64; data = {"key": "value"}; encoded = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(data)).decode("utf-8"); print(encoded)' > encoded.txt
