```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, request
import re
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/redirect')
def redirect_to_valid_hostname():
    '''    
    Obtain target from request and check if it contains a valid domain using regex.
    If yes,accept the result and subsequently redirect to the target URL.
    If not, redirect to the default URL: https://example.com
    '''
    target = request.args.get('target')

    if target:
        # Use a more robust regex for domain validation.  This one is a simplified example.
        # Consider using a dedicated library for URL parsing and validation for production.
        domain_regex = r"^(?:https?://)?(?:www\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)+.*$"  
        if re.match(domain_regex, target):
            return redirect(target)

    return redirect("https://example.com")

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Import `request`:** The `request` object from Flask is needed to access query parameters (like `target` in this case).  The original code was missing this import.

2. **Obtain `target`:**  Use `request.args.get('target')` to safely retrieve the `target` parameter from the URL. This handles the case where the parameter is missing without causing an error.

3. **Improved Regex:** The original regex was overly simplistic and could allow invalid domains. This version is more robust but still not perfect.  A dedicated URL parsing and validation library (e.g., `validators` or `tldextract`) is recommended for production use to handle edge cases and internationalized domain names properly.

4. **Handle Missing `target`:** The code now checks if `target` exists before proceeding with validation.  If `target` is not provided in the query string, it redirects to the default URL.

5. **Default URL:**  A default redirect URL ("https://example.com") is now included for cases where the `target` is invalid or missing.

6. **`debug=True` (for development):**  Running the Flask app with `debug=True` is helpful
