```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask( __name__ )

@app.errorhandler(404)
def page_not_found(e):
    return make_response('<h1>Page not found</h1><p>The requested URL was not found on the server.</p>', 404)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Key changes and explanations:

1. **Completed `make_response`:** The original code was missing the closing parenthesis and the status code for the `make_response` function. I added both:
   - `'<p>The requested URL was not found on the server.</p>'`:  A more informative message for the user.
   - `, 404`:  Crucially, this sets the HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found). Without this, Flask might default to a 200 (OK) status, which is incorrect for a 404 error.

2. **Added `if __name__ == '__main__':` block:** This is standard practice in Flask applications.  It ensures that the `app.run()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module). This prevents accidental running of the development server in unintended situations.

3. **`app.run(debug=True)`:**  This starts the Flask development server in debug mode.  Debug mode is very useful during development, as it provides detailed error messages and automatic reloading when you make changes to your code.  For production deployments, you should set `debug=False`.


This improved code provides a proper 404 error handling response and sets up the Flask application to run correctly.
