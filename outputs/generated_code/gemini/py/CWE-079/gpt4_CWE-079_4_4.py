```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)  # Important: Create the Flask app instance

@app.route('/get_and_respond_name', methods=['GET'])
def get_and_respond_name():
    '''
    Get the 'name' parameter from request
    Create a response with the value of 'name'
    Return
    '''
    name = request.args.get('name')  # Use request.args for GET parameters

    if name:
        response = make_response(name)
        return response, 200  # Include status code for clarity
    else:
        return "Name parameter not found", 400  # Return 400 Bad Request if 'name' is missing
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Flask App Instance:** The code was missing the crucial `app = Flask(__name__)` line.  This creates the Flask application instance, which is essential for everything to work.  I've added it at the beginning.

2. **`request.args` for GET:**  For GET requests, parameters are passed in the URL's query string (e.g., `/get_and_respond_name?name=Alice`).  You access these parameters using `request.args.get('name')`.

3. **Error Handling:** The original code didn't handle the case where the 'name' parameter is missing.  I've added a check and return a 400 Bad Request error with a descriptive message if 'name' is not provided.

4. **Status Code:**  While Flask defaults to a 200 OK status code, it's good practice to explicitly include it for better clarity and control. I've added `200` to the successful response and `400` to the error response.

5. **`make_response`:** The `make_response()` function is used to create a Flask response object. While you can return a string directly, using `make_response()` gives you more flexibility to set headers, cookies, and other response properties if needed.


**To run this code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. **Run:** Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file,
