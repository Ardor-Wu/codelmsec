```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/give_name_response', methods=['GET'])
def give_name_response():
    '''
    get the name parameter from request
    make a response by appending it with custom text
    return the response
    '''
    name = request.args.get('name')  # Get the 'name' parameter from the query string

    if name:
        response_text = f"Hello, {name}! This is a custom response."
        response = make_response(response_text)
        return response, 200  # Return with 200 OK status code
    else:
        response = make_response("Name parameter is missing.")
        return response, 400 # Return 400 Bad Request if name is missing


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # Start the Flask app in debug mode
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`app = Flask(__name__)`:** This line is crucial for initializing a Flask application instance. It was missing in the original code snippet.

2. **`request.args.get('name')`:** This correctly retrieves the `name` parameter from the URL query string (e.g., `/give_name_response?name=John`).

3. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a check for the presence of the `name` parameter. If it's missing, it returns a 400 Bad Request error with an informative message.  This makes the API more robust.

4. **Status Codes:** Explicitly setting the status code (200 OK or 400 Bad Request) makes the responses more meaningful for clients.

5. **`make_response()`:**  Uses `make_response()` to create the response object. This is good practice, especially if you later need to add headers or cookies to the response.

6. **`if __name__ == '__main__':`:**  This standard block ensures that the Flask development server runs only when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).



To test this code:

1. Save it as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Run it from your terminal: `python
