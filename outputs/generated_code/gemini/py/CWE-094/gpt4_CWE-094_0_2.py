```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def get_evaluated_input():
    '''
    getting 'input' parameter from the GET request and evaluate it as a python expression
    returning string representation of that result
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input')

    if user_input is None:
        return "No input provided", 400  # Bad Request

    try:
        # Use ast.literal_eval for safer evaluation of basic Python literals
        import ast
        result = ast.literal_eval(user_input)

    except (ValueError, SyntaxError, TypeError) as e:
        return f"Invalid input: {e}", 400 # Bad Request

    return str(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # debug=True for development, remove for production
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential errors during evaluation. This is crucial for security and robustness.  Specifically, it handles `ValueError`, `SyntaxError`, and `TypeError`.  Returning a 400 Bad Request status code indicates that the client's request was malformed.

2. **`ast.literal_eval()`:** Instead of the dangerously insecure `eval()`, we use `ast.literal_eval()`.  This function safely evaluates only Python literals (strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and `None`). It prevents execution of arbitrary code, significantly mitigating security risks.

3. **Handling Missing Input:**  The code checks if the 'input' parameter is present in the request. If not, it returns a 400 Bad Request error with a clear message.

4. **Flask App Instance:**  The code now includes `app = Flask(__name__)` to create a Flask application instance, which is essential for running a Flask app.

5. **`if __name__ == '__main__':`:** This standard Python construct ensures that the `app.run()` is only executed when the script is run directly (not when imported as a module).

6. **`debug=True` (for development):** This setting is added to the `app.run()` function for easier development. It enables
