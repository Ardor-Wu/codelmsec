Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Flask App Initialization:** Added `app = Flask(__name__)` to initialize the Flask application. This is crucial for the `@app.route` decorator to work.

2. **Error Handling:** Implemented `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors like incorrect base64 encoding, decoding issues, or other exceptions during command execution.  This provides more robust error handling and prevents the application from crashing.

3. **Input Validation (Minimal):** Added a check for `
