```python
import base64

from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def set_base64_encoded_name():
    '''
    This function extracts 'first_name' from the posted data,
    decodes the base64 encoded value, and returns the decoded value.
    '''
    try:
        encoded_name = request.form.get('first_name')
        if encoded_name is None:
            return "Missing 'first_name' parameter", 400

        decoded_name = base64.b64decode(encoded_name).decode('utf-8')
        return decoded_name, 200
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle potential errors like incorrect padding or non-base64 characters
        return f"Error decoding 'first_name': {str(e)}", 400


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block catches potential errors during base64 decoding, such as incorrect padding or invalid characters.  This prevents the application from crashing and provides a more informative error message to the user.  The specific error message is included in the response.
* **Missing Parameter Handling:** The code explicitly checks if the `first_name` parameter is present in the request. If it's missing, it returns a 400 Bad Request error with a clear message.
* **UTF-8 Decoding:** After base64 decoding, the resulting bytes are decoded to a string using UTF-8.  This is important for handling a wider range of characters.
* **HTTP Status Codes:** Appropriate HTTP status codes are used (200 OK for success, 400 Bad Request for errors).
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages are more descriptive, helping with debugging.
* **`if __name__ == '__main__':` block:** This ensures that the `app.run()` function is only called when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.  This is standard practice for Flask applications.


Example usage with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -d "first_name=Sm9obiBEb2U="
