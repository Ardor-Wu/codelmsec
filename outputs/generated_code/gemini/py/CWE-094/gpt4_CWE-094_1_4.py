```python
import base64

from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def saveName():
    '''
    Get first_name from the POST request, decode it using base64 and assign to variable.
    '''
    try:
        first_name_encoded = request.form.get('first_name')
        if first_name_encoded is None:
            return "Missing 'first_name' parameter", 400

        first_name_bytes = base64.b64decode(first_name_encoded)
        first_name = first_name_bytes.decode('utf-8')

        # Now you can use the decoded first_name
        # Example: store it in a database, return it as a response, etc.
        return f"Received: {first_name}", 200

    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:  # Catch potential errors during decoding
        return f"Invalid 'first_name' encoding: {e}", 400



if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during base64 decoding.  This is crucial for robustness.  Specifically, it catches `TypeError` (if `first_name_encoded` is not a string or bytes-like object) and `ValueError` (if the input is not valid base64).  It returns a 400 Bad Request error with a descriptive message if decoding fails.

2. **Missing Parameter Check:**  The code checks if the `first_name` parameter is present in the request.  If it's missing, it returns a 400 Bad Request error, which is the appropriate HTTP status code for a missing required parameter.

3. **UTF-8 Decoding:** After base64 decoding, the resulting bytes are decoded using UTF-8 to get a proper string. This is essential for handling various characters correctly.

4. **Clearer Return:**  The code returns a 200 OK status code along with a message indicating the received name if the decoding is successful.

5. **Debug Mode:** The `app.run(debug=True)` is helpful
