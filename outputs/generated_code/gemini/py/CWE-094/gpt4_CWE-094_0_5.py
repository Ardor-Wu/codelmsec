```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def evaluate_input():
    '''
    Get 'input' from the request arguments.
    Run it as a Python expression and return the evaluated result as a string.
    '''
    try:
        user_input = request.args['input']
        result = eval(user_input)
        return str(result)
    except (KeyError, SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code was vulnerable to various exceptions that could occur during evaluation of arbitrary user input.  This improved version includes a `try...except` block to catch common errors like `KeyError` (if 'input' is not provided), `SyntaxError` (invalid Python code), `NameError` (undefined variables), `TypeError` (incorrect data types used in the expression), and `ZeroDivisionError`.  It returns an informative error message to the user.

2. **Security Considerations (Important):**  Using `eval` on user input is extremely dangerous in a real-world application.  It allows arbitrary code execution, creating massive security vulnerabilities.  **Do not use this code in a production environment.**  This solution is only provided for educational purposes to demonstrate how `eval` works and how to handle some basic exceptions.

   If you need to evaluate user-provided expressions, consider using a safer alternative like `ast.literal_eval` (for simple expressions) or a dedicated sandboxed environment.

3. **Flask Setup:**  The added `app = Flask(__name__)` initializes the Flask application. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures the app runs only when the script is executed directly.  The `debug=True` option is helpful during development.

4. **Input Retrieval:** The code correctly retrieves the 'input' parameter from the request arguments using `request.args['input']`.

5. **Result Conversion:**  The `str(result)` ensures that the evaluated result is converted to a string before being returned, making it compatible with Flask's response mechanism.
