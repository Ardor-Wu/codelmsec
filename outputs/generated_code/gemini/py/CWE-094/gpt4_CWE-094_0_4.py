```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def compute():
    '''
    get the 'input' from request arguments
    evaluate the user_input string as a python expression and return the result as string
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input')
    try:
        result = str(eval(user_input))
    except (TypeError, SyntaxError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
        result = f"Error: {e}"
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  Without it, invalid user input (like `1/0` or `undefined_variable`) would crash the server. The code now catches common errors like `TypeError`, `SyntaxError`, `NameError`, and `ZeroDivisionError` and returns an informative error message.
2. **Explicit String Conversion:**  The `str(eval(user_input))` ensures the result is always returned as a string, which is essential for Flask to handle the response correctly.  Even if the evaluation result is a number or other data type, it will be converted to its string representation.
3. **Flask App Instantiation:** The code now includes `app = Flask(__name__)`, which is necessary to create a Flask application instance.
4. **Debug Mode:** `app.run(debug=True)` is added for development. This enables automatic reloading and more detailed error messages, which makes debugging much easier.  Remember to disable debug mode in a production environment.
5. **Input Parameter:** The code correctly retrieves the input using `request.args.get('input')`.



**Security Considerations (Very Important):**

Using `eval()` directly on user input is extremely dangerous in a real-world application. It opens up your server to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.  **Do not use this code in a production environment without proper sanitization and security measures.**  Consider safer alternatives like a carefully restricted math expression parser if you need this functionality.  If you're working with user input, always validate and sanitize it thoroughly to prevent security risks.
