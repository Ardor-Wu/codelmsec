```python
from django.conf.urls import url
import pickle
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseBadRequest
import base64

@url(r'^(?P<object>.*)$')
def getPickleData(request, object):
    '''
    Unpickle the given object and return it
    '''
    try:
        # URL-safe base64 decode, then unpickle
        unpickled = pickle.loads(base64.urlsafe_b64decode(object.encode()))
        #  Handle the unpickled object.  For example, serialize it to JSON:
        import json
        return HttpResponse(json.dumps(unpickled), content_type="application/json")
    except (pickle.UnpicklingError, ValueError, TypeError, base64.binascii.Error) as e:
        # Return an appropriate error response
        return HttpResponseBadRequest(f"Invalid pickle data or decoding error: {e}")


```

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Base64 Encoding/Decoding:**  Pickle data is binary and not URL-safe.  Directly putting it into the URL will cause problems with special characters. The code now uses `base64.urlsafe_b64encode()` on the client-side (not shown here, but crucial) to create a URL-safe representation and `base64.urlsafe_b64decode()` to decode it back.

2. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is essential.  Unpickling arbitrary data from a URL is a security risk.  The code now catches `pickle.UnpicklingError` (for invalid pickle data), `ValueError` and `TypeError` (for potential issues during decoding or processing), and `base64.binascii.Error` (for base64 decoding errors).  It returns a `HttpResponseBadRequest` with an informative error message.

3. **Response Handling:**  The previous code didn't return anything.  Now, it returns an `HttpResponse`.  I've used `json.dumps()` as an example to serialize the unpickled object into a JSON string, making it easy to handle in JavaScript or other clients. You should adapt this part to your specific needs (e.g., return a different format or use a template).

4. **Request Argument:** The `getPickleData` function now
