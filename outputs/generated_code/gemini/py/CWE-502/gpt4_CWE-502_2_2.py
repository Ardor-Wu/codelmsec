```python
from django.conf.urls import url
import pickle
from django.http import HttpResponse
import base64


def getPickleData(request, pickled):
    """
    URL endpoint that takes a pickled object as argument,
    and returns the result of applying `pickle.loads` on it.
    """
    try:
        # URL parameters are strings, so we need to decode from base64 first.
        pickled_data = base64.b64decode(pickled)
        data = pickle.loads(pickled_data)
        return HttpResponse(str(data))
    except (pickle.UnpicklingError, ValueError, TypeError, base64.binascii.Error) as e:
        return HttpResponse(f"Error: {e}", status=400)



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Base64 Encoding:** URL parameters are strings.  Pickled data is binary.  To pass pickled data in a URL, it needs to be encoded, and base64 is a common and suitable method.  The solution now base64-decodes the `pickled` argument before attempting to unpickle.  This is crucial for correctness.

2. **Error Handling:**  The original code lacked error handling.  `pickle.loads` can raise several exceptions (e.g., `pickle.UnpicklingError` if the data is not valid pickled data, `ValueError` for decoding issues). The improved code now catches these exceptions and returns a 400 Bad Request error response with a descriptive error message.  This makes the endpoint more robust.  I've also added `TypeError` and `base64.binascii.Error` to handle potential issues with the input.

3. **String Conversion of Result:** The `HttpResponse` constructor expects a string.  If the unpickled `data` isn't already a string, using `str(data)` ensures that the response is properly formatted.

**Example Usage (with `urls.py` and how to encode the data):**

```python
from django.urls import path  # Use path instead of the deprecated url
from . import views
import pickle
import base64

urlpatterns = [
    path('pickle/<str:pickled>/', views.getPickleData, name='getPickleData'),
]
