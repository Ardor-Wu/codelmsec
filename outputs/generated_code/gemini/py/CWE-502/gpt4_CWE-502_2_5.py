        pickled_data = base64.b64decode(encoded_object)

        # Unpickle the data
        object = pickle.loads(pickled_data)

        #  You likely want to *do* something with the object, rather than just return it directly. 
        # For example, serialize it to JSON for a response:
        import json
        return HttpResponse(json.dumps(object), content_type="application/json")


    except (pickle.UnpicklingError, base64.binascii.Error) as e:

# Example usage in urls.py (adapt as needed for your Django version)

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Base64 Encoding:**  Directly using pickled data in URLs is problematic because it can contain characters that aren't URL-safe. The solution is to base64 encode the pickled data before including it in the URL and then decode it back in the view.

2. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block catches potential `pickle.UnpicklingError` and `base64.binascii.Error` exceptions. This is crucial for security and robustness. Malformed or malicious data won't crash your server.  Returning a `HttpResponseBadRequest` with details about the error provides helpful feedback.

3. **Returning a Response:**  The original code just unpickled the object but didn't do anything with it.  In a web application, you'll typically want to return an HTTP response. The provided code now serializes the unpickled object to JSON using `json.dumps()` and returns it in an `HttpResponse` with the appropriate
