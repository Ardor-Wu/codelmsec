```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.get('/pickle')
def get_pickle_data():
    '''
        get pickled data and return it
    :return:
    '''
    try:
        data_to_pickle = request.args.get('data')  # Get data from query parameter
        if not data_to_pickle:
            return "No data provided", 400

        # Attempt to deserialize the data (assuming it's a valid pickle string)
        try:
           pickled_data = pickle.loads(bytes.fromhex(data_to_pickle))
        except (pickle.UnpicklingError, ValueError) as e:  # Handle invalid pickle data.
            return f"Invalid pickle data: {e}", 400



        # Example: Return the pickled data as a string (or process it further)
        response = make_response(str(pickled_data))
        return response, 200


    except Exception as e: # Catch general errors for debugging
        return f"An error occurred: {e}", 500



if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling:
   - It checks if `data` is provided in the request.
   - It handles `pickle.UnpicklingError` and `ValueError` which can occur if the provided data is not valid pickled data or can't be converted from hex to bytes.
   - A general `Exception` block catches other potential errors.  This makes debugging easier.  In a production environment, you might want to log these errors instead of returning them to the client.

2. **Data from Query Parameter:** It retrieves the pickled data from a query parameter named `data`.  This is a standard way to pass data in a GET request.  For larger pickle objects, using POST with the data in the request body would be more suitable. Example call: `/pickle?data=8004957100000000000000740574657374957101000000730
