Key improvements and explanations:

* **Base64 Encoding:**  Pickled data isn't directly URL-safe.  We use `base64.b64encode()` on the pickled data *before* putting it in the URL and `base64.b64decode()` in `getPickleData` to convert it back to bytes suitable for `pickle.loads()`. This is crucial for correctly handling the data within the URL.
* **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` block now catches `pickle.UnpicklingError`, `TypeError` (in case the URL parameter is missing or not a string), and `base64.binascii.Error` (in case the base64 decoding fails).  This prevents crashes and allows you to handle invalid or malicious input gracefully.  I've added a `print()` statement for debugging; in a production environment, you would likely log this error more robustly.
* **Return Value:**  The function now returns the unpickled object `defoliated` if successful or `None` if an error occurs. You can change this to return a specific error response or raise a custom exception if needed.
* **URL Pattern:** The URL pattern is improved to capture the object name as a named parameter `object` using `(?P<object>\w+)`. This makes the
