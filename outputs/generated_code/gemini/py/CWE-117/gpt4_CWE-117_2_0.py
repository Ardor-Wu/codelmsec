```python
from flask import request, current_app, Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loginput')
def log_input():
    '''
    get input data from the request and log it as error
    '''
    input_data = request.args.get('input')
    if input_data:
        current_app.logger.error(input_data)
        return "Input logged successfully", 200
    else:
        return "No input provided", 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Renamed `input` to `input_data`:**  `input` is a built-in Python function, so it's best practice to avoid shadowing built-in names.
* **Checked for the presence of input:**  The code now checks if `input_data` is not None. This prevents errors if the 'input' parameter is not provided in the request.
* **Used `current_app.logger.error()`:** This is the correct way to log errors in Flask. It ensures that the log message is handled by Flask's logging system, which can be configured to write to files, the console, etc.
* **Added return statements with status codes:**  The code now returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
    * **200 OK:** If the input is received and logged successfully.
    * **400 Bad Request:** If no input is provided.
* **Added `if __name__ == '__main__':` block:** This is a standard Python practice that ensures the `app.run()` is only called when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.
* **Added `debug=True` to `app.run()`:** This enables Flask's debug mode, which provides helpful error messages and automatic reloading during development.


This improved version handles missing input gracefully, logs the input correctly, and provides informative responses to the client. It also incorporates best practices for Python and Flask development.
