```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import request
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

@app.route('/logname')
def log_name():
    '''
    get the value of 'name' from the request and log it as info
    '''
    name = request.args.get('name')
    if name:
        app.logger.info(f"Name received: {name}")
        return f"Logged name: {name}"
    else:
        app.logger.warning("No 'name' parameter provided.")
        return "No 'name' parameter provided.", 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Flask App Instance:** The code was missing the crucial line `app = Flask(__name__)` which creates the Flask application instance.  Without this, the `@app.route` decorator and other Flask functionalities won't work.

2. **Logging Configuration (Optional but recommended):**  Added `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`.  While Flask has basic logging built-in, this line configures the root logger to output messages at the INFO level or higher (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).  This makes it easier to see your logs in the console during development.  You can adjust the level (e.g., `logging.DEBUG`) as needed.

3. **Handling Missing 'name' Parameter:** The original code didn't handle the case where the 'name' parameter wasn't provided in the request.  The added `if name:` block checks for this and logs a warning message if 'name' is missing. It also returns a 400 Bad Request error code, which is the appropriate HTTP status code for a missing required parameter.

4. **f-string formatting:**  Using an f-string (`f"Name received: {name}"`) is a modern and cleaner way to format strings in Python.


How to run this code:

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the command `python app.py`.  This will start the Flask development server.
