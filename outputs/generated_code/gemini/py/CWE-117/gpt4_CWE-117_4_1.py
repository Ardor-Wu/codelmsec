```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import request
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/log_username')
def log_username():
    '''
    get the "name" parameter from the HTTP request 
    log the retrieved value as info to the server's console
    '''
    name = request.args.get('name')
    if name:
        app.logger.info(f"Received username: {name}")
        return f"Logged username: {name}"
    else:
        app.logger.warning("No 'name' parameter provided.")
        return "Please provide a 'name' parameter in the URL.", 400


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # debug=True for development, remove in production
```


Key improvements:

* **Logging:** Uses `app.logger.info()` which is Flask's recommended logging method.  It's better than just `print()` because it integrates with Flask's logging configuration, allowing you to control log levels, output destinations, formatting, etc.  I've also added a warning log message if the `name` parameter is missing.
* **Error Handling:**  Checks if the `name` parameter is actually present. If not, it returns a 400 Bad Request error, which is the appropriate HTTP status code for this situation. This makes the API more robust.
* **Informative Responses:** Provides feedback to the user by returning a message indicating whether the username was logged or if there was an error.
* **`if __name__ == '__main__':` block:** This ensures that the `app.run()` is only executed when the script is run directly (not when imported as a module).  This is standard practice for Flask apps.
* **`debug=True`:** This is useful during development, but remember to remove or set it to `False` in a production environment.


To test this:

1. Run the Python script.
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/log_username?name=testuser` (replace `testuser` with any name).
3. You should see the log message "Received username: testuser" printed in your console.  The browser will display "Logged
