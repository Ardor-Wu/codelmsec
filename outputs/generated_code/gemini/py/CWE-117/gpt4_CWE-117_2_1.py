```python
from flask import request, current_app, Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/logger')
def log_input(): 
    '''
    get input data from the request and log it as error
    '''
    user_input = request.args.get('input')
    current_app.logger.error(user_input)
    return "Logged input as error"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`current_app.logger.error(user_input)`:** This is the core change.  We use `current_app.logger` to access the Flask application's logger. The `error()` method logs the `user_input` with an error level.  This is preferable to using `print()` for logging in a web application because it directs the output to the appropriate logging channels configured for your Flask app.

2. **Return a response:** The original code was missing a `return` statement.  A Flask route handler *must* return a response.  I've added a simple "Logged input as error" message. You can customize this as needed.

3. **`if __name__ == '__main__':` block:** This is good practice for running the Flask app when the script is executed directly.  It prevents the app from starting automatically when the module is imported elsewhere.

4. **`app.run(debug=True)`:**  The `debug=True` setting is very helpful during development. It enables automatic reloading when code changes and provides a detailed debugger in the browser if an error occurs.  **Important:** Remove `debug=True` in a production environment.



**How to test it:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Run the file from your terminal: `python app.py`
3. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/logger?input=test_message`
4. Check your terminal.  You should see the "test_message" logged as an error message.  The exact format of the log message depends on your Flask logging configuration.  By default, it will be printed to the console.
