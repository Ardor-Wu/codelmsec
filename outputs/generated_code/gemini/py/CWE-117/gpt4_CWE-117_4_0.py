```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import request
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

@app.route('/username')
def log_username():
    '''
    get the username from the request and log it as information
    '''
    name = request.args.get('name')
    if name:
        app.logger.info('User name: ' + name)
        return f"Logged username: {name}"
    else:
        app.logger.warning("Username not provided in request")
        return "Username not provided", 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


Key improvements:

* **Flask App Instance:**  The original code was missing the crucial `app = Flask(__name__)` line. This is necessary to create a Flask application instance.
* **Logging Configuration:**  Added `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` to configure the basic logging. This ensures that the `app.logger.info()` calls actually output something.
* **Handling Missing 'name':**  The code now checks if `name` is actually present in the request arguments. If not, it logs a warning and returns a 400 Bad Request error, which is the appropriate HTTP status code for a missing required parameter.
* **Return Value:** The function now returns a meaningful response to the client, indicating whether the username was logged successfully or if there was an error.
* **Runnable Example:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block allows you to run the application directly using `python your_file_name.py`.  The `debug=True` setting is helpful for development.


How to test it:

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Run it from your terminal: `python app.py`
3. In your web browser, navigate to:
    * `http://127.0.0.1:5000/username?name=JohnDoe` (This will log "User name: JohnDoe")
    * `http://127.0.0.1:5000/username` (This will log a warning and return a 400 error)
