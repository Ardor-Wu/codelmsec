Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Correct `tarfile` mode:** The `mode` argument in `tarfile.open` should be `'r:gz'` to correctly open a tar.gz file.  Just `'r:'` is incomplete.

2. **Error Handling:** The `download_and_extract_tar` function now includes a `try...except` block.  This is crucial for handling potential errors like network issues, invalid URLs, or problems with the archive itself.  It prevents your script from crashing and provides informative error messages.

3. **Informative Output:** Added `print` statements to indicate success or failure and provide details about any errors encountered.

4. **Clearer Function Definition:** Improved the docstring for `extract_and_remove_tar` to be more descriptive.

5. **Example Usage:** Included example usage to demonstrate how to use the `download_and_extract_tar` function.  Remember to replace the example URL with your actual URL.
