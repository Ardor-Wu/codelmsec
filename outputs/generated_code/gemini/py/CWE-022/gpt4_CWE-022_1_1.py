Key improvements:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors during file operations. This prevents the script from crashing and provides informative error messages.  Specifically, it handles `tarfile.TarError` for tar-related issues, `FileNotFoundError` if the tar file doesn't exist, and `OSError` for problems deleting the file.
* **Early Exit on Extraction Failure:** If the tar file extraction fails, the function now returns early, preventing the attempt to delete a potentially partially extracted archive.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Error messages now specify the type of error and the
