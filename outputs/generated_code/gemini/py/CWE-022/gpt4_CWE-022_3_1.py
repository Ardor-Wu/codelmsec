```python
import tarfile
import os

def untar_file(fileName):
    """
    Extracts all files from the given tar file.
    """
    # Using `tarfile.open` to open the tar file
    try:
        tar = tarfile.open(fileName, "r:*")  # Use "r:*" to handle various compression methods
        tar.extractall()  # Extract all members to the current directory
        tar.close()
    except tarfile.TarError as e:
        print(f"Error opening or extracting tar file: {e}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Tar file not found: {fileName}")
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`r:*` mode:**  Instead of just `"r"`, using `"r:*"` allows the function to handle tar files compressed with various methods (gzip, bzip2, xz, etc.).  This makes the function more robust.

2. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors:
   - `tarfile.TarError`: Catches errors related to opening or extracting the tar file (e.g., corrupted tar file).
   - `FileNotFoundError`: Catches errors if the specified tar file does not exist.  This prevents the program from crashing.

3. **Clearer Error Messages:** The `print` statements in the `except` blocks provide more informative error messages, making it easier to understand what went wrong.

4. **`tar.close()`:** Although Python's garbage collector would eventually close the file, it's good practice to explicitly close it using `tar.close()` after you're finished with it.  This ensures resources are released promptly.


Example usage:

```python
filename = "my_archive.tar.gz"  # Or .tar.bz2, .tar.xz, etc.
untar_file(filename)
```
