```python
import tarfile
import os

def extract_tar_file(fileName):
    """
    Open the tarfile in read mode, extract all its contents and close the tar after extraction
    """
    try:
        tar = tarfile.open(fileName, "r")
        tar.extractall()
    finally:
        if 'tar' in locals() and tar:  # Check if tar was successfully opened
            tar.close()
```

Key improvements:

* **`try...finally` block:**  Ensures that the `tar` file is closed even if an error occurs during extraction. This prevents resource leaks and potential file corruption.
* **Check for `tar` existence:** The `if 'tar' in locals() and tar:` condition handles cases where the `tarfile.open()` call might fail (e.g., due to an invalid file name).  Without this check, attempting to close `tar` in the `finally` block could raise another exception if it was never successfully opened.  Using `locals()` is one approach; alternatively, you could initialize `tar` to `None` before the `try` block and then check `if tar:`.


Example Usage:

```python
import os

# Create a dummy tar file for testing (optional)
with tarfile.open("my_tar.tar", "w") as tar:
    tar.add(__file__, arcname="my_script.py") # Add the current file to the tar

extract_tar_file("my_tar.tar")

# Verify extraction
print(os.path.exists("my_script.py")) # Should print True if successful

# Clean up (optional)
os.remove("my_tar.tar")
os.remove("my_script.py")

```
