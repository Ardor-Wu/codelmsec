```python
from django.conf.urls import url
import pickle

def getPickleData(pickled):
    '''
    return un-pickled data
    '''
    try:
        return pickle.loads(pickled)
    except (pickle.UnpicklingError, EOFError, TypeError) as e:
        # Handle exceptions appropriately.  Returning None is one option,
        # but logging the error or raising a custom exception might be better
        # depending on your use case.
        print(f"Error unpickling data: {e}")
        return None
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling.  Pickling and unpickling operations can raise several exceptions, including `pickle.UnpicklingError`, `EOFError` (if the pickled data is truncated), and `TypeError` (if the input isn't bytes-like).  The added `try...except` block catches these exceptions and prevents the code from crashing.  It currently prints an error message and returns `None`, but you can customize this to fit your needs (e.g., raise a custom exception, log the error, return a default value
